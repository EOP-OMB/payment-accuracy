    pro1: 'Due to the expanse and extent of damage tied to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma,
      and Maria, many CBP facilities suffered damage. Disaster Supplemental Funding
      received addresses facility reconstitution costs due to damage incurred, primarily
      to facilities located in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.


      For the testing conducted in 2023, CBP’s assessment was focused on the associated
      FY 2021 disaster supplemental funding disbursements of over $10 million applicable
      for review under PIIA. Per the Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief
      Requirements, 2017 (P.L. 115-56, the Additional Supplemental Appropriations
      for Disaster Relief Requirements Act of 201 7 (P.L. 11572), and the Further
      Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act,
      2018 (P.L. 115-123); in FY 2021, the program disbursed more than $10M in disaster
      supplemental funding. As such, the program is publishing an improper payment
      estimate over this disbursement activity in 2023.


      As this is the first year that testing has been conducted and reported for the
      CBP – Procurements, Construction, and Improvement – Disaster Supplemental Funds
      program, a second consecutive year of testing is expected to be completed with
      results published in 2024. DHS is confident that the program will continue to
      publish payment integrity results that remain below the OMB Circular A-123,
      Appendix C guidance threshold to be considered susceptible to significant improper
      payments.'

  2024:
    pro1: "Due to the expanse and extent of damage tied to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma,\
      \ and Maria, many U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facilities suffered\
      \ damage. Disaster Supplemental Funding received addresses facility reconstitution\
      \ costs due to damage incurred, primarily to facilities located in Puerto Rico\
      \ and the U.S. Virgin Islands. For the testing conducted in 2024, CBP’s assessment\
      \ was focused on the associated fiscal year (FY) 2022 Procurement, Construction,\
      \ and Improvements (PC&I) disaster supplemental funding disbursements of over\
      \ $10 million applicable for review under the Payment Integrity Information\
      \ Act of 2019 (PIIA). Per the Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief\

      \ Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act,\
      \ 2018 (P.L. 115-123); in FY 2022, the program disbursed more than $10M in disaster\
      \ supplemental funding and had not yet completed two years of consecutive testing\
      \ to have baselined the program. As such, the program is publishing an improper\
      \ payment estimate over this disbursement activity in 2024. \n\nThe CBP PC&I\
      \ - Disaster Supplemental Funds program has identified or reported Improper\
      \ Payments (IPs) and Unknown Payments (UPs) below the Office of Management and\
      \ Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-123, Appendix C guidance thresholds to be considered\
      \ susceptible to significant improper payments for two consecutive years. As\
      \ such, the CBP PC&I - Disaster Supplemental Funds program is expected to revert\
      \ back to Phase 1, in accordance with the OMB Circular No. A-123, Appendix C\
      \ guidance, for the 2025 reporting cycle."
    rnp4: "Department-wide, Component managers are responsible for completing internal\
      \ control work on payment processing as part of the Department’s Office of Management\
      \ and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-123 efforts. They are further responsible\
      \ for establishing and maintaining sufficient internal controls, including a\
      \ control environment that prevents improper payments from being made, effectively\
      \ managing improper payment risks, and promptly detecting and recovering any\
      \ improper payments that may occur. Management’s efforts, to include within\
      \ DHS Headquarters as well Components, around improper payments are subject\
      \ to an annual compliance review by the DHS’s Office of Inspector General (OIG).\
      \ These measures are designed to hold the appropriate personnel accountable\
      \ for meeting applicable improper payment reduction targets and establishing\
      \ and maintaining strong internal controls around payment management. \n\nDepartment-wide,\
      \ the goals and requirements for strong payment integrity are communicated to\
      \ all levels of staff throughout the DHS Office of the Chief Financial Officer\
      \ and to relevant program office and procurement staff. The Department has taken\
      \ extensive measures to ensure that managers, accountable officers, to include\
      \ Component Chief Financial Officers (CFOs), programs, States, and localities\
      \ are held accountable for reducing and recapturing improper payments. The Department’s\
      \ CFO and senior staff have incorporated improper payment expectations and performance\
      \ in their annual performance plans. \n\nBased on the current testing results,\
      \ the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) feels that no additional actions\
      \ are necessary to reduce Improper Payments (IPs) as results indicate that processes\
      \ and internal controls applied have been sufficient. Although the CBP Procurements,\
      \ Construction, and Improvement (PC&I) – Disaster Supplemental Funds program\
      \ has identified or reported IPs and Unknown Payments (UPs) error rates below\
      \ the OMB Circular No. A-123, Appendix C guidance thresholds to be considered\
      \ susceptible to significant improper payments, appropriate accountability will\
      \ continue to be enforced."

    rnp3: The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Procurement, Construction,
      and Improvements (PC&I) – Disaster Supplemental Funds program completed a census
      review approach to review the fiscal year (FY) 2021 disbursement activity for
      Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) reporting in 2023. For 2024
      PIIA reporting, the program again utilized a census review to assess the FY
      2022 disbursement activity. As such, all disbursement activity from FY 2021
      and FY 2022 has been reviewed. As indicated by the publication of no identified
      improper payments and/or unknown payments, the program has sufficiently proven
      that it is being executed with strong internal controls and sufficient human
      capital, information system, and infrastructure support. With no substantial
      changes to the program anticipated, CBP is confident that the current resourcing
      and internal control environment relevant to the PC&I - Disaster Supplemental
      Funds program will remain adequate to prevent and/or reduce improper payments
      and unknown payments with no additional planned or taken corrective actions.

    cyp20_2: The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Procurement, Construction,
      and Improvements (PC&I) – Disaster Supplemental Funds program completed a census
      review approach to review the fiscal year (FY) 2021 and FY 2022 disbursement
      activity. As such, all disbursement activity was reviewed. Results indicated
      no Improper Payments (IPs) or Unknown Payments (UPs). Overall, DHS believes
      that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-123, Appendix
      C guidance threshold of 1.5 percent, used to determine program susceptibility
      for significant improper payments, to be tolerable for the program and thus
      both the tolerable rate and reduction target have been set to 1.5 percent. However,
      as the CBP PC&I - Disaster Supplemental Funds program has identified or reported
      IPs and UPs below the OMB Circular No. A-123, Appendix C guidance thresholds
      to be considered susceptible to significant improper payments for two consecutive
      years, the program has baselined and is expected to revert back to Phase 1 for
      the 2025 reporting cycle. Also, as the program disbursement level continues
      to fall, as soon as the annual disbursement level drops below $10 million, the
      program will no longer be subject to Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019
      (PIIA) reporting requirements.
    rap5: As indicated by the publication of no identified Improper Payments (IPs)
      and/or Unknown Payments (UPs) for two consecutive years, the program has sufficiently
      proven that it is being executed with strong internal controls and sufficient
      human capital, information system, and infrastructure support. With no substantial
      changes to the program anticipated, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)
      is confident that the current resourcing and internal control environment relevant
      to the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements (PC&I) - Disaster Supplemental
      Funds program will remain adequate to prevent and/or reduce IPs and UPs.
    rap6: No additional resources have been requested. As indicated by the publication
      of no identified Improper Payments (IPs) and/or Unknown Payments (UPs), the
      U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Procurement, Construction, and Improvements
      (PC&I) – Disaster Supplemental Funds program has sufficiently proven that it
      is being executed with strong internal controls and sufficient human capital,
      information system, and infrastructure support.
