    pro1: 'FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund (DRF): Individuals and Households Program (IHP)
      provides financial and direct services to eligible individuals and households
      affected by a disaster, who have uninsured or under-insured necessary expenses
      and serious needs. FEMA determines the appropriate types of Housing Assistance
      for which an individual or household may be eligible based on disaster-caused
      loss, access to life-sustaining services, cost-effectiveness, and other factors.
      Individuals and households may receive more than one type of Housing Assistance,
      including a combination of financial assistance and direct services for disaster-caused
      damage to a disaster survivor’s primary residence.


      Applicants may also receive financial assistance for other disaster-caused necessary
      expenses and serious needs. The types of other needs assistance are divided
      into two categories of assistance that are either dependent or non-dependent
      on the applicant’s ability to secure a U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA)
      disaster loan. The SBA provides low-interest, long-term loans to help eligible
      applicants with transportation losses, moving and storage expenses, as well
      as repair/replacement funds for real and personal property damage caused by
      the disaster.


      For the testing conducted in 2021, FEMA’s assessment was focused on the associated
      FY 2019 disaster supplemental funding disbursements of over $131 million applicable
      for review under PIIA. For additional information on the results of this assessment,
      please refer to the FY 2021 published data on paymentaccuracy.gov.


      Based on Phase 2 statistical testing performed over the Federal Emergency Management
      Agency (FEMA) - Disaster Relief Fund (DRF): Individuals and Households Program
      - Disaster Supplemental Funds program, results published in FY 2020 (over FY
      2018 disbursements) and FY 2021 (over FY 2019 disbursements) indicated that
      the program was not susceptible to significant improper payments. In accordance
      with OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C guidance, although FY 2020 disbursements
      remained over $10M, DHS has determined that the program has been baselined and
      has converted the program back to Phase 1 for FY 2022 reporting based on the
      quantitative results of the testing.  In addition, FY 2021 outlays for the program
      have reduced to below $10M. As such, the program is no longer eligible for PIIA
      reporting in the current year.'

    rnp3: FEMA Leadership prioritizes the annual PIIA assessments and has high expectations
      of reducing IPs and UPs. FEMA Leadership stresses the importance of being a
      good steward of taxpayer dollars which is trickled down the FEMA levels of hierarchy.
      Root cause analyses are performed at the completion of PIIA testing for each
      program which are used a basis for creating the respective MAPs as well as improving
      the respective internal control environments. Overall, the IPs and UPs are decreasing.
      Additionally, FEMA will be conducting training and require routine meetings
      with stakeholders as needed.

    rap5: Program is reflective of disaster supplemental funding that was received
      by DHS to respond to the Hurricane Harvey, Irma, and Maria disasters that occurred
      in the 2017 / 2018 timeframe. Due to the burden of testing and reporting, Disaster
      Supplemental Funding programs are tested and reported two years in arrears.
      As such, by the time that remedial action is taken and/or is realized in the
      PIIA testing results, the total value of annual disbursements is expected to
      be below the threshold for PIIA action. DHS will continue to make process and
      internal control improvements to improve the payment management processes as
      it relates to supplemental funding but feels that internal control, human capital,
      information system, and infrastructure needs have been met.
