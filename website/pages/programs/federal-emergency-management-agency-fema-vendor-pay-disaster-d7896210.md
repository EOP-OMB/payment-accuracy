    pro1: 'FEMA strives to disburse prompt payments for goods and services that are
      covered by the Prompt Payment Act. Most of the payments falling under the VP
      program are contractual, to include rental and lease agreements, purchase orders,
      delivery orders, blanket purchase agreements, etc., invoice payments based on
      the receipt of satisfactory performance of contract terms.


      For testing conducted in FY 2020 (over FY 2019 disbursements), payments made
      from Disaster Supplemental Funds had been included within the larger FEMA Vendor
      Pay program. Based on the breakout of the stratums within that program''s statistical
      approach, results indicated that payments made from the Supplemental Appropriations
      funding accounted for approximately a 2.50% estimated error rate.  Based on
      FY 2022 reporting (over FY 2020 disbursement activity), the improper payment
      rate for the program has improved and has declined below the OMB thresholds
      to be considered susceptible to significant improper payments.'

    rnp3: FEMA engages with process owners in monthly remediation meetings to assure
      appropriate accountable officials are actively taking actions to reduce improper
      payments and identify and categorize unknown improper transactions as either
      proper or improper. If unknown transactions are deemed proper no further action
      is taken. If a transaction is deemed administratively improper FEMA requires
      a corrective action be put in place in order resolve issues surrounding procedures
      policies and trainings. If a transaction is deemed technically improper then
      the transaction is submitted through our debt collection process including Notice
      of Potential Debt Letters and Treasury Offset if applicable. In FY 23, FEMA
      will conduct periodic status meetings to make sure all parties are tracking
      and resolving improper payments through its remediation process.

    cyp20_2: 'DHS has published the reduction target for the Federal Emergency Management
      Agency (FEMA) - Vendor Pay - Disaster Supplemental Funds program at the same
      0.70%.


      However, based on the two consecutive years of testing results (over FY 2019
      and FY 2020 disbursements) and the fact that DHS considers the program baselined,
      the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) - Vendor Pay - Disaster Supplemental
      Funds program is expected to be converted back to Phase 1, in accordance with
      OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C guidance, for the FY 2023 reporting.'
    rap5: DHS has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human capital
      and information system and other infrastructure to reduce improper payments
      and unknown payments to the tolerable rate for the Federal Emergency Management
      Agency (FEMA) - Vendor Pay - Disaster Supplemental Funds program.

    cyp2_1: Due to the nature of vendor payments program, DHS believes that all payments
      disbursed are within the agency's control. Therefore, all resulting improper
      payments, to include overpayments, for the Federal Emergency Management Agency
      (FEMA) - Vendor Pay - Disaster Supplemental Funds program have been determined
      to be within the control of the agency.

    cyp6_1: For the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) - Vendor Pay - Disaster
      Supplemental Funds made technically improper payments due to failure to follow
      statutory regulations regarding FAR 52.232-5 related to Prompt Payment, formalization
      of contractual period of performance adjustments, and assignment of disaster
      supplemental funding. The payments to the vendors were owed and thus not monetary
      loss nor an overpayment to be processed for recoupment.
