Actions_By_Year:
  2023:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Unit/Office level actions will focus on issues that
      can cause IP's/UP's such as compensation rate reviews and official pay rate
      determinations. Use of Cross Enterprising sharing will help the program's effort
      to focus on the cause of eligibility issues such as offsetting and deceased
      persons. Monthly medical bill pay audits ensure the program's medical bill contractors
      are processing payments consistent with program requirements.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app17_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: 'The program will continue to use training corrective
      action plans. As a result of staff

      turnover training continues throughout the year and the program utilizes on
      the spot corrective action and training to ensure issues are identified on the
      case level.'
    Mitigation_Strategy: app3_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: The program uses its own auditing work to determine
      corrective actions through the fiscal year. Additionally, the program uses any
      relevant findings from the agency's annual financial audit to make corrective
      actions to reduce improper payments. This corrective action is an iterative
      and cyclical.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp17_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: 'The agency has a robust training program in place to
      prevent improper payments.

      Training is done at the unit/office level as well as through the National Office.
      There is also training for corrective actions available using online platforms.
      This corrective action is an iterative and cyclical, OWCP provides ongoing training
      to staff - it is never complete'

    rnp4: The program has staff responsible for establishing and maintaining sufficient
      internal controls toward the reduction of IPs.  The program incorporates internal
      controls into the annual performance standards of agency managers and subordinate
      staff to ensure focus on understating and preventing IPs.  Agency managers are
      held responsible and accountable for meeting proper payment rates.  On a monthly
      basis, managers are required to submit results of IPs identified through audit
      results and supervisor reviews.  The program also conducts quarterly meetings
      with the OIG and the medical bill contractor's staff to discuss the identification
      of potentially fraudulent activity.
