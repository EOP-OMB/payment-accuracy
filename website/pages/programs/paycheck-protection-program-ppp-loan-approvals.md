    pro1: "In accordance with program regulations, when a PPP Lender received a forgiveness\
      \ application from a borrower, the Lender reviewed the application and submitted\
      \ a forgiveness decision to SBA. If the lender determined that the borrower\
      \ was entitled to forgiveness of some or all of the amount applied for, the\
      \ lender requested payment from SBA at the time the lender issued its decision\
      \ to SBA.  SBA, subject to any SBA review of the borrower's loan(s) or loan\
      \ application(s), remitted the appropriate forgiveness amount to the lender,\
      \ plus any interest accrued through the date of payment.\n\nSBA reviewed the\
      \ forgiveness applications from lenders.  SBA compared the loan amount disbursed\
      \ to the amount of loan forgiveness requested.  In general, any loan amounts\
      \ not forgiven were determined to be improper.  \n\nSBA reviewed borrower eligibility,\
      \ (including whether the borrower had been debarred; whether the borrower had\
      \ defaulted on federal debt within the last 7 years; whether the borrower had\
      \ been convicted of a felony involving fraud, bribery, or embezzlement; whether\
      \ the borrower was incarcerated; and, whether the borrower was a U.S. citizen)\
      \ and reviewed documentation to determine whether the borrower’s business was\
      \ in operation.  Borrowers that were not eligible based on these eligibility\
      \ criteria were denied forgiveness.  The full amount of the loan disbursed for\
      \ these forgiveness denials was determined to be improper.  \n\nSBA also reviewed\
      \ documentation to determine whether borrowers had eligible expenses during\
      \ the covered period, and, if so, in what amount.  SBA determined that borrowers\
      \ with no eligible expenses during the covered period had received the loan\
      \ improperly, and the full amount of the loan was determined to be improper.\
      \  If a borrower had eligible expenses that did not equal the amount of the\
      \ loan disbursed, only that portion of the loan forgiven was determined to be\
      \ proper. The remaining unforgiven portion was determined to be improper. \n\
      \nImproper payment rates for the Paycheck Protection Program loans were reported\
      \ for the first time in FY2022.  The program ended on May 31, 2021.  No loans\
      \ were awarded after the program end date.\n"

    rnp3: Overpayments are the result of the borrower receiving a PPP loan in an amount
      that (1) exceeds the borrower’s eligibility, (2) that cannot supported through
      documentation, or (3) that was not used for purposes permitted by statute or
      guidance.  In its review of the loan, if SBA determines that the loan is not
      eligible for forgiveness (in whole or in part), the borrower must begin paying
      principal and interest.

    cyp20_2: Improper payment rates for the Paycheck Protection Program loans were
      reported for the first time in FY2022.  The program ended on May 31, 2021.  No
      loans were awarded after the program end date, therefore, SBA did not establish
      a program target reduction rate for FY2023.
    rap5: The agency has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human capital
      and information system and other infrastructure to reduce improper payments
      and unknown payments to the tolerable rate.
    rap6: No resources have requested in the most recent budget submission of the
      agency to establish and maintain the internal controls.
    rtp4_2: This is the first year the program is reporting improper payment data.  As
      such, there is insufficient historical data to establish a tolerable rate.
