Actions_By_Year:
  2023:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: To continue communications across data sources even
      though the PUA program ended September 2021
    Mitigation_Strategy: app17_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: 'The reporting period for the PUA program is the entire
      life of the program (April 2020 through September 2021) therefore, actions taken
      span this entire period.


      PUA is a temporary program that ended by law in September 2021. A contributing
      cause of improper and unknown payments calculated for the reporting period for
      the program was the result of a number of states failing to perform or document
      performance of key data cross-matches. Training was identified as one of the
      actions taken to address improper and unknown payments. Through training opportunities
      such as ETA webinars that discussed its guidance, training and instructions
      on using tools like the Integrity Data Hub and various crossmatches, as well
      as individual technical assistance from regional offices, states were able to
      improve identity verification activity. This improvement directly impacts a
      state’s ability to ensure the social security numbers used in the UI claims
      process by UI applicants, in fact belong to these applicants and also ensures
      that the applicant is not eligible for unemployment compensation benefits under
      other programs. In doing so, states are able to reduce improper and unknown
      payments.


      Additionally, the use of cross enterprise sharing helps states to gain access
      to a more comprehensive pool of data that can assist as they attempt to verify
      the identity to UI applicants in various categories such as, across agencies
      or across states. This kind of access broadens the reach of the state verification
      process and can help in its efforts to reduce improper and unknown payments
      due to identity.

  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: 'The Department-funded UI Integrity Center completed
      and published multiple lessons to the NASWA Learning Management System, which
      included eLearning lessons in Data Analysis, the Integrity Data Hub (IDH), and
      the Behavioral Insights curricula.


      The UI Integrity Center received 1,417 new learner enrollments for FY 2023,
      bringing total all-time enrollments to 16,297 learners. In FY 2023, the UI Integrity
      Center conducted the Basic UI Fraud Investigations course 19 times to a total
      of 319 learners. More than 225 hours of eLearning instruction are available
      in seven certificate tracks, and 208 individual lessons and courses are offered
      via eLearning, virtual classrooms, and instructor led training.


      Additionally, the UI Integrity Center’s IDH team actively works with states
      to implement the datasets available through the IDH for the prevention and detection
      of improper payments and fraud in the UI program. The IDH team conducts bi-weekly
      IDH update calls with states and provides direct technical assistance and peer-to-peer
      engagements. The IDH team also continued conducting onsite IDH implementation
      support services, which are designed as short, in-person engagements with states
      to provide training and aid states with the understanding and utilization of
      the IDH system and results data.


      ETA and the UI Integrity Center also presented and provided UI-related trainings
      at virtual and in-person conferences throughout FY 2023.

      \ with states and coordinate fraud prevention and overpayment recovery efforts.\
      \ In FY 2023 ETA’s collaboration with DOL-OIG included the following:\n\n•\t\
      Discussions with DOL-OIG regarding civil prosecutions and exploring possibilities\

      \ Center released the DOL-OIG Integrity Data Hub (IDH) Interface to production.\
      \ The DOL-OIG IDH Interface allows approved OIG Investigators to easily request\
      \ and receive a report of IDH results sent to states, which identifies UI claims\

      \ a national call with states and DOL-OIG to share techniques DOL-OIG uses to\
      \ prepare UI data for analysis to identify trends indicating potential fraud\
      \ and to provide states with information on money mule operations.\n•\tShared\
      \ DOL-OIG curated news articles each month with ETA Regional Offices to ensure\
      \ Regional Offices and states remain aware of the ongoing UI fraud arrests,\
      \ actions, and prosecution efforts of federal, state, and local law enforcement.\
      \ ETA also shared the updated #StopRansomware Guide with ETA Regional Offices\
      \ and states, which was developed through the Joint Ransomware Task Force, as\
      \ a resource to help organizations reduce the risk of ransomware incidents through\
      \ best practices to detect, prevent, respond and recover, including step-by-step\
      \ approaches to address potential attacks.\n\nIn FY 2023, ETA participated on\
      \ banking workgroup calls to discuss ongoing fraud prevention and detection\
      \ issues and overpayment recovery efforts. The calls help keep banking organizations,\
      \ federal government agencies, and law enforcement agencies aware of the emerging\
      \ fraud schemes targeting different sectors, while also streamlining communications\
      \ to aid in the recovery and return of fraudulently obtained and overpaid funds\
      \ and benefits.\n\nIn working with states, the UI Integrity Center develops\
      \ and disseminates tools and products to highlight best practices and provides\
      \ operational recommendations to improve UI program performance and reduce improper\

      \ an online, searchable, knowledge-sharing platform that includes a repository\
      \ of all UI Integrity Center resources including, model state operational processes,\
      \ promising state practices, and recommendations to strengthen UI program integrity.\
      \ In FY 2023, the UI Integrity Center continued to add UI integrity-related\
      \ resource documents to the Library, bringing total available UI integrity-related\
      \ resources to over 2,800.\n\nThe Library’s COVID-19 special collection, dedicated\

Additional_Information_By_Year:
  2023:
    pro1: The PUA program was unlike any program previously administered by state
      UI agencies – the program had unique eligibility requirements and served a population
      of workers not previously covered by unemployment compensation programs.  States
      had to stand up the operations of this new and unique program immediately. Many
      states lacked the basic IT infrastructure to implement PUA with the full spectrum
      of integrity checks that would have been implemented at a time when the world
      was not in a crisis. Due to a lack of funding or failure to invest in modern
      systems, some states were using IT systems that had been obsolete for decades.  In
      addition, the program, by statutory design relied heavily on claimant self-attestation
      to key eligibility requirements for the first 10 months of the program’s 18
      months existence.  This exposed the program to significant fraud activity.  As
      a result, DOL made major investments in enhancing the fraud detection functionality
      of the UI Integrity Data Hub and has resulted in significant increases in states
      participating and using the Integrity Data Hub and other integrity-related tools
      and services.

    cyp2_1: State agencies were responsible for processing applications for PUA compensation
      according to federal law and guidance. Part of this process involves a determination
      of whether the applicant has eligibility for unemployment benefits under another
      program and verification of the identity of the applicant, as well as the information
      provided by the applicant at the time of application through the continued claim
      process. To do this, state agencies utilize several tools and workflows such
      as wage/earnings crossmatches, investigation of inconsistencies, obtaining and
      maintaining claims documentation, or ensuring compliance with state law. These
      tools and/or functions are exclusively available to state agencies for use throughout
      the life of a claim. Therefore, inadequate use of these options/functions is
      within the control of the state agency.

      made by state Reviewers who were tasked with reviewing sampled PUA cases. However,
      in some of these cases, they could not carry out a full review since the information
      to determine payment accuracy was either unavailable or not sufficient to make
      a determination on the accuracy of the payment.
