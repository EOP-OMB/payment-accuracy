  2023:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: The root causes of improper payments were failure to
      access data/information and statutory requirements of program not met. The major
      findings for this category were due to acreage reports not on file or signed
      for the affected crops, and data used does not match Risk Management Agency
      data. The Farm Service Agency has increased cooperation with the Risk Management
      Agency for succeeding ad hoc disaster programs by streamlining the application
      process using existing payment calculations provided by the Risk Management
      Agency that were used to provide auto populated applications for payment to
      producers. The program has ended; however, the corrective actions will be applied
      to succeeding ad hoc disaster programs.

    rap5: "Farm Service Agency continues to strategically take the necessary steps\
      \ to strengthen internal controls measures, establish uniform consistency for\
      \ compliance processes, and improve accountability. Farm Service Agency’s aim\
      \ is to not only make these improvements at the program specific level but to\
      \ initiate transformation at the overall arching and broader Agency level. \n\
      \nFarm Service Agency will require key resources to continue its progression\
      \ towards strengthening internal controls and addressing the inconsistencies\
      \ with certain programs reporting more than the statutory improper payment threshold\
      \ in fiscal year 2022.   \n\nHuman Capital Needs: National and State Office\
      \ Compliance Resources - To resolve the Agency’s noncompliance issues in a timely\
      \ manner, strengthen program integrity and accountability and maintain an ongoing\
      \ compliance oversight strategy, additional compliance staff will be crucial\
      \ for Farm Service Agency to build a comprehensive and robust compliance program.\
      \  \n\nFarm Service Agency once had staff positions whose main responsibility\
      \ involved monitoring and addressing compliance related issues within states\
      \ known as Farm Service Agency County Operations Reviewer, but these positions\
      \ were transferred in fiscal year 2019 from Farm Service Agency to the Farm\
      \ Production and Conservation Business Center, Performance, Accountability and\
      \ Risk Division during the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center\
      \ reorganization.  This transfer caused a hardship on Farm Service Agency’s\
      \ internal controls program and significant resource and specialized knowledge\
      \ gaps are still prevalent today, which is contributing to Farm Service Agency’s\
      \ capacity to timely and adequately address various compliance issues and requirements.\
      \  Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division are\
      \ evaluating the current set up to seek improvements as it relates to Farm Service\
      \ Agency program compliance.  In addition, Farm Service Agency’s existing staff\
      \ continues to be stretched with the responsibilities of training new staff,\
      \ administering Farm Service Agency programs, performing existing County Operations\
      \ Reviewers duties, and addressing new compliance requirements, all as collateral\
      \ duties. Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division\
      \ are developing a new work plan to better address this issue and goal by first\
      \ quarter fiscal year 2023 to define an improved workplan to support compliance\
      \ review.\n\nInformation Systems’ Needs – Farm Service Agency is positioning\
      \ itself to take preventive measures through automated processes that are built\
      \ into business systems to reduce errors.  Automation improves productivity\
      \ and enforces procedural compliance; therefore, Farm Service Agency is exploring\
      \ better approaches to integrate internal controls functions into the implementation\
      \ of programs, as well as maintenance of an existing program systems. Given\
      \ these efforts, the Agency is planning to request Congressional funding for\
      \ enhancing:  1) transactional program systems/software to quickly meet the\
      \ implementation demands of pandemic, emergency, and disaster programs and 2)\
      \ interface systems to allow data sharing and eliminate manual/duplicative entries\
      \ and processes. \n\nSeveral transactional program systems and software “work\
      \ arounds” and manual processes still exist that are contributing to the increase\
      \ of program improper payments. Funding is needed to resolve current deficiencies\
      \ and build internal controls requirements within these systems. \n\nFrom an\
      \ internal controls oversight perspective, Farm Service Agency has invested\
      \ in the Internal Review Documentation and Tracking System and continues to\
      \ incorporate manual-paper based program reviews and spot-checks into automated\
      \ processes within the system.  The objectives for Internal Review Documentation\
      \ and Tracking System are to improve oversight capabilities to State and National\
      \ program managers, supplement data mining efforts and formally document review\
      \ results for program analysis and enrichment. This effort is ongoing and is\
      \ planned through fiscal year 2024. \n\nOther Infrastructures Needs - As part\
      \ of the Agency’s new integrated compliance plan, the design will incorporate\
      \ further actions to address meeting program reduction targets, including but\
      \ not limited to: 1) changing the current sampling methodology to using better\
      \ sound statistical, survey, and data collection methodologies that elevate\
      \ past issues of  “oversampling” and inefficient use of resources, while also\
      \ ensuring the program dollars are delivered to all producers who are legally\
      \ entitled to them; 2) utilizing a risk-based approach, where program risks\
      \ and risk tolerances are identified to allow the right internal controls to\
      \ be put in place, establish program metrics that gages the success of meeting\
      \ objectives and need for improvements; 3) integrating a more proactive use\
      \ of data mining to identify program key performance indicators, anomalies,\
      \ fraud, waste, and abuse; and 4) performing a validity reassessment of current\
      \ program oversight processes, such as oversight checklists, redelegation of\
      \ authorities for approvals, etc.  \n\nThese actions will also assist in capturing\
      \ program impacts to targeted arenas of the historically underserved groups\
      \ and determining where increased efforts are needed to improve accessibility\
      \ to Farm Service Agency programs and services. For example, implementing routine\
      \ sampling of denied applications on historically underserved groups to verify\
      \ if approval and disapproval decisions are being made accurately. \n\nFarm\
      \ Service Agency is also coordinating with Farm Production and Conservation\
      \ Business Center and the Department on the multi-year data management efforts\
      \ to improve transparency, data mining, intelligence dashboards, and program\
      \ analysis.  Equally, significant investments in the development and utilization\
      \ of program dashboards and visualizations have been made by Farm Service Agency.\
      \  These efforts are helping to increase transparency, augment analytics capacity\
      \ and make data readily available to support important mission-focused decision-making.\
      \  \n\nFarm Service Agency has built a number of dashboards to provide visualizations\
      \ for its major Farm Programs and Farm Loan Programs, such as Coronavirus Food\
      \ Assistance Program 1, Coronavirus Food Assistance Program 2, Wildfires and\
      \ Hurricanes Indemnity Program Plus, Dairy Margin Coverage, Agriculture Risk\
      \ Coverage and Price Loss Coverage, Conservation Reserve Program, Farm Loan\
      \ Program Direct Loan Portfolio, Farm Loan Program Loan Obligations, program\
      \ payments, acreage reporting, etc.  Nationwide administrative dashboards to\
      \ view office workload, productivity, and the geographic servicing areas for\
      \ Farm Service Agency leadership and managerial staff have also been developed\
      \ throughout fiscal year 2022.\n \n"

      and accountability processes to provide reasonable assurances that internal
      controls are in place and operating effectively.  A continuous evaluation system
      which monitors the effectiveness of internal controls is in place but is not
      sufficient to reduce improper payments rates.
