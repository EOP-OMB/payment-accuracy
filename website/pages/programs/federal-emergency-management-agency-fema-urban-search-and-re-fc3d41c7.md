  2022:
    pro1: 'The National Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) Response System, established
      under the authority of the Federal Emergency Management Agency in 1989, is a
      framework for organizing federal, state, and local partner emergency response
      teams as integrated federal disaster response task forces. US&R task forces
      can be deployed by FEMA to a disaster area to provide assistance in structural
      collapse rescue, or they may be pre-positioned when a major disaster threatens
      a community. Each US&R task force is composed of members specializing in search,
      rescue, medicine, hazardous materials, logistics and planning, including technical
      specialists such as physicians, structural engineers, and canine search teams.


      Disaster response is locally executed, state/territory managed and federally
      supported. Local fire departments, emergency management, and local and state
      law enforcement are the first to arrive at the scene and begin rescue. As the
      Disaster Supplemental Funding was provided to assist in Hurricane Harvey, Irma,
      and Maria response and assistance, US&R response was largely focused in the
      locations of Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.


      For the testing conducted in 2021, FEMAâ€™s assessment was focused on the associated
      FY 2019 disaster supplemental funding disbursements of over $15 million applicable
      for review under PIIA. For additional information on the results of this assessment,
      please refer to the FY 2021 published data on paymentaccuracy.gov.


      Based on Phase 2 statistical testing performed, results published in FY 2020
      (over FY 2018 disbursements) and FY 2021 (over FY 2019 disbursements) indicated
      that the program was not susceptible to significant improper payments. In accordance
      with OMB Circular A- 123, Appendix C guidance, DHS has determined that the program
      has been baselined and has converted the program back to Phase 1 for FY 2022
      reporting based on the quantitative results of the testing. In addition, FY
      2020 and FY 2021 disbursement totals for the Federal Emergency Management Agency
      (FEMA) - Urban Search and Rescue - Disaster Supplemental Funds program have
      dropped below $10M, thus the program is no longer eligible for PIIA reporting
      in the current year.'

    rnp3: FEMA Leadership prioritizes the annual PIIA assessments and has high expectations
      of reducing IPs and UPs. FEMA Leadership stresses the importance of being a
      good steward of taxpayer dollars which is trickled down the FEMA levels of hierarchy.
      Root cause analyses are performed at the completion of PIIA testing for each
      program which are used a basis for creating the respective MAPs as well as improving
      the respective internal control environments. Overall, the IPs and UPs are decreasing.
      Additionally, FEMA will be conducting training and require routine meetings
      with stakeholders as needed.

    rap5: Program is reflective of disaster supplemental funding that was received
      by DHS to respond to the Hurricane Harvey, Irma, and Maria disasters that occurred
      in the 2017 / 2018 timeframe. Due to the burden of testing and reporting, Disaster
      Supplemental Funding programs are tested and reported two years in arrears.
      As such, by the time that remedial action is taken and/or is realized in the
      PIIA testing results, the total value of annual disbursements is expected to
      be below the threshold for PIIA action. DHS will continue to make process and
      internal control improvements to improve the payment management processes as
      it relates to supplemental funding but feels that internal control, human capital,
      information system, and infrastructure needs have been met.
