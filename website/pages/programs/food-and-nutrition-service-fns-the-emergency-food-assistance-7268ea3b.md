    rnp3: "Per 7 CFR 251.10(a)(3), “(3) Household information. Each distribution site\
      \ must collect and maintain on record for each household receiving TEFAP commodities\
      \ for home consumption, the name of the household member receiving commodities,\
      \ the address of the household (to the extent practicable), the number of persons\
      \ in the household, and the basis for determining that the household is eligible\
      \ to receive commodities for home consumption.”\nThe only federal financial\
      \ requirement for TEFAP eligibility is that States must have an income-based\
      \ standard.  Each State sets their own threshold and guidelines and are solely\
      \ responsible for the data.  Local agencies must collect and maintain on record\
      \ the basis for determining household eligibility.  This financial data is unavailable\
      \ to the National Office, as it is kept at the local agency level. This could\
      \ lead to improper payments if a local agency gave commodities to ineligible\
      \ individuals. \n\nImproper payments are monitored during Federal Management\
      \ Evaluations (ME) of State Operations.  MEs are conducted by FNS Regional Offices\
      \ and include a review of all program operations including inventory controls,\
      \ certification procedures, and administrative expense controls. \n\nAdditionally,\
      \ State agencies are required to review Local Program operations.  As part of\
      \ these reviews, State agencies evaluate how local organizations conduct eligibility\
      \ determinations, food ordering procedures, storage and warehousing practices,\
      \ inventory controls, and adherence to reporting and recordkeeping requirements.\
      \ \n\nAudits and inspections are also conducted by the Office of Inspector General\
      \ (OIG) or independent auditors and evaluate program operations, identify program\
      \ issues, and uncover potential funding discrepancies.\n\n"
