    Description_Action_Taken: "Serious Deficiency Proposed Rule\nThe Food and Nutrition\
      \ Service (FNS) proposed a revision to the Serious Deficiency (SD) process for\
      \ Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) and the Summer Food Service Program\
      \ (SFSP) in a Proposed Rule. After the Proposed Rule was published in February\
      \ 2024, FNS hosted webinars and presentations at conferences attended by stakeholders.\
      \ The Proposed Rule’s public comment period ended May 21, 2024. At that point\
      \ FNS assessed the comments on the proposed rule and began drafting a Final\
      \ Rule. In addition, FNS began work on a companion application designed to help\
      \ State agency users apply the SD process when evaluating the performance of\
      \ CACFP program sponsors and facilities. Together, these will streamline the\
      \ SD process and provide a user-friendly method for accurately implementing\
      \ the process. This will improve our method for identifying and ultimately addressing\
      \ SDs in CACFP.\n\nChild Nutrition (CN) Program Integrity Rule \nFNS expects\
      \ the rule’s provisions to strengthen the administration of CN programs, at\
      \ all levels, through enhanced oversight and enforcement tools designed to help\
      \ FNS and state administering agencies to reduce program error of all types,\
      \ resulting in more efficient operations and improved compliance with program\
      \ requirements. Of particular importance to the National School Lunch Program\
      \ (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP), the rule allows States to adopt\
      \ a 5-year administrative review cycle for School Food Authorities (SFAs); previously\
      \ states reviewed SFAs a minimum of once every three years. States that adopt\
      \ a review cycle longer than three years must establish and apply risk-based\
      \ criteria to select SFAs for targeted follow-up reviews. This change allows\
      \ states to direct limited resources where attention is needed most.  FNS released\
      \ guidance on the updated review cycle December, 2023. The rule also formalizes\
      \ a framework for developing, testing, and introducing integrity-focused process\
      \ improvements to address improper payment challenges that cannot be remedied\
      \ through monitoring alone.\n\nCN Dashboards\nOn March 26, 2024, FNS made a\
      \ set of State Agency CN data dashboards available to State CN agencies. The\
      \ tool aims to promote state agency access to performance data for their own\
      \ analysis. To coincide with publishing the dashboards, FNS launched a CN dashboard\

    pro1: 'The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) Family Day Care Home (FDCH)
      Tiering Decision is a Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)-funded state administered
      program that provides free and reduced-price meals and snacks to children and
      adults in low-income areas, or approved by application, while at a day care
      home or facility. At the local level, CACFP is administered by state-approved
      sponsoring organizations. FNS issues program funds to state agencies, which
      then pass the funds to CACFP sponsoring organizations to run the program. Sponsoring
      organizations use that money to cover both the food and administrative costs
      of the program. FNS is contracted with Westat to develop an improper payment
      estimate for CACFP in accordance with a Sampling and Estimation Methodology
      Plan (S&EMP) submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
      This study is nearing completion but has not yet been released. Previously,
      a study was done that found tiering error (claiming based on the higher level
      of pay of tier 1 rather than tier 2) among FDCHs to be a significant portion
      of the error in this program. FNS has applied the error rate determined by that
      study to the outlays for FDCHs. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, tiering
      was set aside, and therefore the only measure of error that we would normally
      report was not applicable while this waiver was active. The outlays FNS is reporting
      are the outlays where tiering error was measured. Outlays for CACFP totaled
      $3.9 billion (pulled from FNS''s keydata report on September 8, 2023, Table
      15d, https://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/overview) for the entire Fiscal Year (FY) 2022.
      During FY 2023, FNS undertook and planned the following activities to mitigate
      CACFP improper payments: 1) State agencies must offer training to sponsors each
      year prior to the annual sponsor application period. The training covers the
      sponsoring organization’s responsibilities and the site supervisor’s responsibilities.
      Every sponsoring organization must send key staff members (including directors)
      to that State agency training in order to be eligible to participate in the
      program. As a condition of approval to participate, and as part of their program
      agreement with the State agency, sponsoring organizations commit to training
      their site monitors and site personnel. 2) FNS Regional Offices also completed
      three Management Evaluations (MEs) per region, each of which include a local
      level review where FNS staff accompany State agencies on reviews of local operators.
      MEs provide a periodic assessment of State agency operations and administration;
      and can result in a report of findings which require the state agency to correct
      any problems. This helps to ensure that State agencies are properly monitoring
      meal claims at the local level; and are working with local operators to reduce
      any improper payments.


      Correction to the 2022 Data Call:  The outlays reported in the 2022 Data Call,
      representing Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) Family Day Care Home
      (FDCH) Tiering Decision Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 outlays, was incorrect. FNS reported
      total program outlays of $4.3B instead of FDCH Tiering Decision component costs
      of $581M. Currently, CACFPs sampling and estimation plan includes improper payment
      measurement for one of three components, the FDCH. The other two components,
      Child Care Centers and Adult Day Care Facilities, are not included in the improper
      payment reporting because FNS is still determining how to estimate the improper
      payment rates for these two components. As a result, the CACFP FDCH Tiering
      Decision improper payment estimate of 0.070% in the FY 2022 www.paymentaccuracy.gov
      reporting is lower than it should have been. The correct improper payment estimate
      should have been at 0.527%.'
    rnp4: null
  2024:
    pro1: In prior years, the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) improper payment
      rate only included estimates based on the Family Day Care Home (FDCH) Tiering
      study. With the completion of the analysis for Erroneous Payments in Child Care
      Centers Study (EPICCS), FNS is able to obtain an improper payment rate for Centers,
      and have split CACFP reporting into FDCHs and Centers. The FDCH improper payment
      rates utilize the same tiering error study as previous years but is only applied
      to Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 Quarter 4, due to the Keep Kids Fed Act (KKFA) in effect
      for Quarter 1-Quarter 3. The KKFA  reimbursed all Homes at Tier I rates, equating
      to no tiering error and no improper payments. Note that in last year's FY2023
      reporting, FNS reported no error in CACFP because waivers allowed all FDCHs
      to receive Tier I rates for all quarters of FY2022.
    rnp4: In order to ensure manager, program, and State-level accountability through
      annual performance appraisal criteria for payment integrity and meeting Improper
      and Unknown Payment reduction targets, the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)
      Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) Family Day Care Home (FDCH) Tiering
      Decision has implemented binding agreements to operate program according to
      all program rules. FNS has a robust review process that includes State-level
      review of local program operators and FNS-level reviews of States to ensure
      program integrity within the program. Applicable for Fiscal Year (FY) 2023,
      FNS has issued a policy memo to State program operators of the CACFP FDCH Tiering
      Decision entitled, "Area Eligibility for Summer 2022 and School Year 2022-2023",
      providing guidance on determining CACFP eligibility when school data is unavailable.
      FDCHs use school or census data to establish geographic eligibility. FNS Regional
      Offices are completing three (3) Management Evaluations (MEs) per region, each
      of which also includes a local level review where FNS staff accompany State
      agencies (SAs) on reviews of operators. MEs provide a periodic assessment of
      SA operations and administration and can result in a report of findings, which
      require the SA to correct any problems. This helps to ensure that SAs are properly
      monitoring certification and meal counting at the local level and are working
      with local operators to reduce improper payments. In addition, FNS continues
      to provide technical assistance related to the $50M released in FY 2024 for
      non-competitive Technology Innovation Grant (nTIG) funds for Child Nutrition
      (CN) State agencies to improve information technology (IT) systems. Throughout
      FY 2023, FNS worked with grant recipients who are using funds to develop, improve,
      maintain CN IT systems. FNS expects that the overall improvement of information
      technology systems by nTIG recipients administering CACFP will improve the SAs
      ability to train, monitor, provide technical assistance, and take corrective
      actions.

    rtp4_2: Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is committed to ensuring integrity in
      the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) Family Day Care Home (FDCH) -
      Tiering Decision in order to protect taxpayer dollars and safeguard the meals
      that millions of children rely on at child care. FNS is reporting that it has
      not yet determined a tolerable rate for CACFP that fully balances payment integrity
      risk and controls while executing the program's processes to maximum possible
      effect as allowed under statute.

    cyp20_2: The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) Family Day Care Home (FDCH)
      - Tiering Decision reduction target of 0.54 is equal to the estimated future
      Improper Payment and Unknown Payment rate because the goal is to maintain a
      near-zero error rate. It is not fiscally reasonable to spend additional funds
      on reducing a program's error rate that is already less than 5%.
    rap5: Given the highly decentralized nature of the Child and Adult Care Food Program
      (CACFP), it is cost prohibitive for Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) to calculate
      annual improper payment rates and dollar values using a census approach. Instead,
      FNS must rely on estimates developed through periodic studies. FNS has developed
      a measurement methodology for the Family Day Care Home (FDCH) Tiering Decision
      component of the program, and a separate methodology for the remaining components
      of Child Care Centers and Adult Day Care Facilities via the Erroneous Payments
      in Child Care Centers Study (EPICCS). Because requirements vary significantly
      by program component, a full and rigorous assessment of the rate of improper
      payments is extremely complex. FNS continues to explore alternative methodologies
      for developing a reliable measurement for the FDCH Tiering Decision meal claims
      component. FNS is committed to ensuring integrity in CACFP in order to protect
      taxpayer dollars and safeguard the meals that millions of children rely on at
      childcare. Therefore, FNS is reporting that it has not yet determined a tolerable
      rate for CACFP that fully balances payment integrity risk and controls while
      executing the program's processes to maximum possible effect as allowed under
      statute.
    rap6: "An increase of $19,489,000 and 42 Full Time Equivalent (FTE) in Training\
      \ and Technical Assistance ($45,996,000 and 59 FTE available in 2024). \nEffective\
      \ and continual training and technical assistance are necessary to help States\
      \ properly administer the Child Nutrition Programs (CNPs) and to ensure States\
      \ are equipped to identify and prevent fraud and abuse. This includes a total\
      \ of $17.1 million for current law proposals, $3.8 million of which is for a\
      \ 2025 proposal and $13.3 million is for 2024 re-proposals. The requested increase\
      \ includes $3.8 million and 19 staff to support the 2025 Current Law Proposal:\
      \ Increase Funding for Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) Implementation,\
      \ $1.3 million and 7 staff to support the 2024 Current Law Re-proposal: Federal\
      \ Administration of Summer EBT. Both current law proposals support Federal implementation\
      \ and oversight of the new Summer EBT program. The balance of the 2024 Current\
      \ Law Re-proposal: Federal Administration of Summer EBT is split between the\
      \ Child Nutrition (CN) Payment Accuracy and Training and Technical Assistance\
      \ budget lines. The next current law proposal is for $10 million and 16 staff\
      \ to support the 2024 Current Law Re-proposal: Increase Training and Technical\
      \ Assistance, which enhances the Food and Nutrition Service’s ability to provide\
      \ critical training, technical assistance, and oversight to ensure program integrity\
      \ and compliance with Federal law and regulations for CN in both national and\
      \ regional offices. The fourth current law proposal for $2 million is to support\
      \ the 2024 Current Law Re-proposal: Enterprise Risk Management: helps with approaches\
      \ in FNS strategic planning and program operations. The remaining increase is\
      \ due to inflation and 2025 pay cost. \n\nAn increase of $2,743,000 in CN Studies\
      \ ($21,005,000 and 13 FTE available in 2024). \nFNS conducts a variety of studies,\
      \ evaluations, and related activities that respond to the needs of policy makers\
      \ and managers and help ensure that nutrition assistance programs achieve their\
      \ goals effectively, which include improving public health, nutrition, and equity.\
      \ This program line supports the critical evaluations needed for the CN Programs,\
      \ including the Federal staff needed to oversee this vital work. The request\
      \ includes $2 million for the 2025 Current Law Proposal: Research on the U.S.\
      \ Territories. The remaining increase is due to inflation and 2025 pay cost.\n\
      \nAn increase of $9,248,000 and 28 FTE in CN Payment Accuracy ($12,315,000 and\
      \ 72 FTE available in 2024).\nThis funding supports FNS’s robust Federal oversight,\
      \ monitoring, and technical assistance, which are essential to the identification,\
      \ prevention, and resolution of erroneous payments. This includes a total of\
      \ $8.2 million for current law proposals: $4 million and 20 staff to support\
      \ the 2025 Current Law Proposal: Investment in Regional Financial Management\
      \ for Program Integrity, which helps regional Grants Management and Administrative\
      \ Services (GMAS) Staff across CN Program accounts. The next current law proposal\
      \ is for $3 million to support the 2024 Current Law Re-proposal: Strengthen\
      \ CACFP Program Integrity, which will spread through a variety of activities\
      \ including data mining and a technical assistance support center designed to\
      \ support States in identifying and addressing program integrity risks. The\
      \ third current law is for $1.2 million and 8 staff to support the 2024 Current\
      \ Law Re-proposal: Federal Administration of Summer EBT. The balance of the\
      \ 2024 Current Law Re-proposal: Federal Administration of Summer EBT is split\
      \ between the CN Payment Accuracy and Training and Technical Assistance budget\
