Actions_By_Year:
  2023:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: TRSUI calculates the provider distribution amounts based
      upon the minutes submitted and the current rate in the database. Calculations
      are randomly checked by signers when reviewing distribution documents. TRS will
      continue to rely on the system calculations unless errors arise.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app1_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: The error was a manual error therefore the actions were
      focused on how to catch a manual error, if needed, in the future.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app17_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: A discussion took place with the process owner of the
      TRS Provider Distribution process in September 2023. The process owner was instructed
      to update all TRS signers who approve payments when any file intervention must
      take place. It is rare for manual overrides to be made on the payment files
      but in the situation where it must be done, they must notify the signers of
      what manual overrides had to be performed as well as the impact of those overrides
      to ensure signers recalculate any calculations a 2nd and 3rd time.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app3_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Provider Distribution Process documentation was updated
      for the item discussed in ATP3_1. Future internal control audits and PIIA reporting
      will include this as a note for any manual calculations being performed.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app6_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: The cause of the improper payment was manual error therefore
      the training performed was to make the process owner aware that any manual revisions
      or calculations must be communicated to the signers to make them aware.

    rnp3: The actions taken were aimed at making the Distribution signers responsible
      for approving payment aware when manual intervention takes place. Manual intervention
      is typically needed roughly once a year therefore automation is relied upon
      the majority of the time. Due to the limited times that this happens as well
      as the severity of the finding, no further automation or action is needed at
      this time.

    cyp20_2: Error rate found in current reporting year amounted to .000004% therefore
      we are currently projecting that the future year will have 0% error rate.
    rap5: The error found was a result of manual intervention which is rare in the
      regular course business. TRS has adequate systems, human capital and internal
      controls over this process. The changes implemented will help to open communication
      for further questions and analysis if manual intervention is needed in the future.
    rap6: No resources were requested in the most recent budget submission of the
      agency to establish and maintain the current internal controls.
