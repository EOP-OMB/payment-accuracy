    Description_Action_Taken: As of January 1, 2022, the SBA stopped accepting applications
      for new COVID EIDL loans. As of May 6, 2022, the SBA was no longer processing
      COVID EIDL increase requests or requests for reconsideration of previously declined

      is no longer originating loans or disbursing newly approved funds under this
      program. Therefore, no Auditing corrective action(s) are planned for the COVID
      EIDL program.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app6_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: The actions taken were focused on the cause of the Improper
      Payments and Unknown Payments by providing training that specifically targeted
      what caused the improper payment, and steps to take to prevent such improper
      payments. Additionally, DICD quality assurance reviews are designed to identify
      the causes of improper or potentially improper payments and advise the PDC Departments
      accordingly.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp17_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: The Training corrective action(s) taken include quarterly
      training to Processing and Disbursement Center (PDC) staff on the causes and
      prevention of, improper payments. In accordance with Numbered Memo (NM) 22-04,
      the PDC Departments are required to develop and conduct improper payment training
      to address the Improper Payment Audit deficiencies identified.  Further, the
      PDC Director or designee must certify to the Director of Internal Controls or
      designee, that the training has been completed.  Training corrective actions
      are not being taken going forward as the COVID EIDL program stopped accepting
      new applications on January 1, 2022, and as of May 6, 2022, ceased acceptance
      of loan increase requests or requests for reconsideration of previously declined
      applications and therefore are no longer originating loans or disbursing newly
      approved funds.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp3_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: The Audit corrective action(s) taken include the performance
      of ongoing quality assurance reviews of PDC Departments' loan origination and
      disbursement activities to identify improper and potentially improper payments,
      and to identify areas  in which the PDC Departments may require additional training
      to reduce the possibility of future improper payments, The Disaster Internal
      Control Division (DICD) are not conducting quality assurance reviews for COVID
      EIDL program going forward, as the program has ended and is no longer originating
      loans or disbursing newly approved funds.

Additional_Information_By_Year:
  2021:
    pro1: null
    rnp4: null
  2022:
    pro1: The Small Business Act authorizes the SBA to make EIDL loans to eligible
      small businesses and nonprofit organizations located in a disaster area.  On
      March 6, 2020, Congress deemed COVID-19 to be a disaster, thus allowing the
      SBA to declare disasters and make EIDL loans available to small businesses and
      nonprofit organizations suffering substantial economic injury as a result of
      the COVID-19 pandemic.

    rnp3: SBA's COVID-EIDL program ended as of December 31, 2021.  No further corrective

    rnp3: As of January 1, 2022, the SBA stopped accepting applications for new COVID
      EIDL loans. As of May 6, 2022, the SBA was no longer processing COVID EIDL increase
      requests or requests for reconsideration of previously declined loan applications.
      As of May 16, 2022, the COVID EIDL portal was closed.  SBA is no longer originating
      loans or disbursing newly approved funds under this program requiring planned
      actions.   Therefore, no actions are planned (in the corrective action plan)
      addressing the causes of the Improper Payments and Unknown Payments, that are
      proportional to the severity of the associated amount and rate of the root cause.

    cyp15: 'Yes'
    cyp20_2: Because COVID-EIDL program ended as of December 31, 2021, the improper
      payment estimates for FY 2023 will only consist of any loan increases and reconsiderations
      that were disbursed after March 31, 2022.  For FY 2023, the SBA established
      a reduction target of 4.40 percent for the COVID-EIDL program.
    rap5: The SBA has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human capital
      and information system and other infrastructure to reduce improper payments
      and unknown payments to the tolerable rate.
    rap6: No resources have been requested in the most recent budget submission of
      the agency to establish and maintain the internal controls.
    rtp4_2: This is the first year the program is reporting improper payment data.  As
      such, there is insufficient historical data to establish a tolerable rate.

    cyp15: 'Yes'
    cyp20_2: Because the COVID EIDL program ended as of December 31, 2021, the FY
      2023 improper payment estimates only consisted of re-disbursements of previously
      rejected disbursements or loan increases and reconsiderations disbursed after
      March 31, 2022; there is no new funding for this program. Therefore, there is
      no reduction target rate established for FY 2024.
    rap5: As of January 1, 2022, the SBA stopped accepting applications for new COVID
      EIDL loans. As of May 6, 2022, the SBA was no longer processing COVID EIDL increase
      requests or requests for reconsideration of previously declined loan applications.
      As of May 16, 2022, the COVID EIDL portal was closed. Therefore, the program
      has ended and is no longer originating loans or disbursing newly approved funds
      and a tolerable rate has not been determined for this program. Thus, internal
      controls, human capital and information system and other infrastructure to reduce
      Improper Payments and Unknown Payments to the tolerable rate are no longer required
      for this program.
    rap6: No resources have been requested in the most recent budget submission of
      the agency to establish and maintain the internal controls discussed in RAP5.  As
      of January 1, 2022, the SBA stopped accepting applications for new COVID EIDL
      loans. As of May 6, 2022, the SBA was no longer processing COVID EIDL increase
      requests or requests for reconsideration of previously declined loan applications.
      As of May 16, 2022, the COVID EIDL portal was closed. Therefore, the program
      has ended, is no longer originating loans or disbursing newly approved funds,
      and internal control activities are no longer required for this program.
    rtp4_2: The tolerable rate has not been determined for this program because as
      of January 1, 2022, the SBA stopped accepting applications for new COVID EIDL
      loans. As of May 6, 2022, the SBA was no longer processing COVID EIDL increase
      requests or requests for reconsideration of previously declined loan applications.
      As of May 16, 2022, the COVID EIDL portal was closed. Therefore, the program
      has ended and is no longer originating loans or disbursing newly approved funds.

    Inability_to_Access_Data: 0.0
    cyp2_1: The root cause of overpayments on the COVID EIDL program was failure to
      access data/information. The most prevalent causes of improper payments stemmed
      from missing verification of business ownership, incorrect accounting of duplication
      of benefits, missing franchise documentation, and incorrect calculation of economic
      injury.  The loan originations and subsequent disbursement of loan funds to
      eligible borrowers for a correct amount in material compliance with the Loan
      Authorization and Agreement, SBA regulations, state and federal laws, Standard
      Operating Procedures (SOPs), COVID EIDL program guidelines, and other applicable
      SBA guidance, is within the agency's control.
