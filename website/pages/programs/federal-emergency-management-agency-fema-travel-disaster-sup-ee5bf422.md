    pro1: "Under typical disaster operations, responders are moved to the disaster\
      \ response area via commercial travel options or on roadways from nearby states,\
      \ as possible. However, limitations on air travel due to capacity constraints\
      \ and power outages can result in the requirement to coordinate and mobilize\
      \ agency partners to provide chartered transportation until commercial travel\
      \ options can be fully resumed. For the testing conducted in 2021, FEMAâ€™s assessment\
      \ was focused on the associated FY 2019 disaster supplemental funding disbursements\
      \ of over $108 million applicable for review under PIIA. For additional information\
      \ on the results of this assessment, please refer to the FY 2021 published data\
      \ on paymentaccuracy.gov. \n\nAlthough FY 2020 disbursement totals related to\
      \ the Supplemental Appropriations remained above $10M, based on Phase 2 statistical\
      \ testing performed, results published in FY 2020 (over FY 2018 disbursements)\
      \ and FY 2021 (over FY 2019 disbursements) indicated that the program was not\
      \ susceptible to significant improper payments. In accordance with OMB Circular\
      \ A-123, Appendix C guidance, DHS has determined that the program has been baselined\
      \ and has converted the program back to Phase 1 for FY 2022 reporting based\
      \ on the quantitative results of the testing. In addition, FY 2021 disbursement\
      \ totals for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) - Travel - Disaster\
      \ Supplemental Funds program dropped below $10M, thus the program is no longer\
      \ eligible for PIIA reporting in the current year."

    rnp3: FEMA Leadership prioritizes the annual PIIA assessments and has high expectations
      of reducing IPs and UPs. FEMA Leadership stresses the importance of being a
      good steward of taxpayer dollars which is trickled down the FEMA levels of hierarchy.
      Root cause analyses are performed at the completion of PIIA testing for each
      program which are used a basis for creating the respective MAPs as well as improving
      the respective internal control environments. Overall, the IPs and UPs are decreasing.
      Additionally, FEMA will be conducting training and require routine meetings
      with stakeholders as needed.

    rap5: Program is reflective of disaster supplemental funding that was received
      by DHS to respond to the Hurricane Harvey, Irma, and Maria disasters that occurred
      in the 2017 / 2018 timeframe. Due to the burden of testing and reporting, Disaster
      Supplemental Funding programs are tested and reported two years in arrears.
      As such, by the time that remedial action is taken and/or is realized in the
      PIIA testing results, the total value of annual disbursements is expected to
      be below the threshold for PIIA action. DHS will continue to make process and
      internal control improvements to improve the payment management processes as
      it relates to supplemental funding but feels that internal control, human capital,
      information system, and infrastructure needs have been met.
