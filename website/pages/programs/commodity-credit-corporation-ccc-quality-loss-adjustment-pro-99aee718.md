      \ failed to be accessed or entered, or entered incorrectly.  Data was entered\
      \ from Wildfires,  Hurricanes and Indemnity Program Plus Information Reports\
      \ or other supporting documentation. Furthermore, Salesforce had design limitations\
      \ that required manual entry for data elements that could affect payments when\

      \ has addressed these errors through training, such as National training and\
      \ Quality Loss Adjustment Program's monthly calls that were held with State\
      \ office specialists during and after signup. These trainings are posted on\
      \ the Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs' internal training page and available\

    rap5: "Farm Service Agency continues to strategically take the necessary steps\
      \ to strengthen internal controls measures, establish uniform consistency for\
      \ compliance processes, and improve accountability. Farm Service Agency’s aim\
      \ is to not only make these improvements at the program specific level but to\
      \ initiate transformation at the overall arching and broader Agency level. \n\
      \nFarm Service Agency will require key resources to continue its progression\
      \ towards strengthening internal controls and addressing the inconsistencies\
      \ with certain programs reporting more than the statutory improper payment threshold\
      \ in fiscal year 2022.   \n\nHuman Capital Needs: National and State Office\
      \ Compliance Resources - To resolve the Agency’s noncompliance issues in a timely\
      \ manner, strengthen program integrity and accountability and maintain an ongoing\
      \ compliance oversight strategy, additional compliance staff will be crucial\
      \ for Farm Service Agency to build a comprehensive and robust compliance program.\
      \  \n\nFarm Service Agency once had staff positions whose main responsibility\
      \ involved monitoring and addressing compliance related issues within states\
      \ known as Farm Service Agency County Operations Reviewer, but these positions\
      \ were transferred in fiscal year 2019 from Farm Service Agency to the Farm\
      \ Production and Conservation Business Center, Performance, Accountability and\
      \ Risk Division during the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center\
      \ reorganization.  This transfer caused a hardship on Farm Service Agency’s\
      \ internal controls program and significant resource and specialized knowledge\
      \ gaps are still prevalent today, which is contributing to Farm Service Agency’s\
      \ capacity to timely and adequately address various compliance issues and requirements.\
      \  Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division are\
      \ evaluating the current set up to seek improvements as it relates to Farm Service\
      \ Agency program compliance.  In addition, Farm Service Agency’s existing staff\
      \ continues to be stretched with the responsibilities of training new staff,\
      \ administering Farm Service Agency programs, performing existing County Operations\
      \ Reviewers duties, and addressing new compliance requirements, all as collateral\
      \ duties. Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division\
      \ are developing a new work plan to better address this issue and goal by first\
      \ quarter fiscal year 2023 to define an improved workplan to support compliance\
      \ review.\n\nInformation Systems’ Needs – Farm Service Agency is positioning\
      \ itself to take preventive measures through automated processes that are built\
      \ into business systems to reduce errors.  Automation improves productivity\
      \ and enforces procedural compliance; therefore, Farm Service Agency is exploring\
      \ better approaches to integrate internal controls functions into the implementation\
      \ of programs, as well as maintenance of an existing program systems. Given\
      \ these efforts, the Agency is planning to request Congressional funding for\
      \ enhancing:  1) transactional program systems/software to quickly meet the\
      \ implementation demands of pandemic, emergency, and disaster programs and 2)\
      \ interface systems to allow data sharing and eliminate manual/duplicative entries\
      \ and processes. \n\nSeveral transactional program systems and software “work\
      \ arounds” and manual processes still exist that are contributing to the increase\
      \ of program improper payments. Funding is needed to resolve current deficiencies\
      \ and build internal controls requirements within these systems. \n\nFrom an\
      \ internal controls oversight perspective, Farm Service Agency has invested\
      \ in the Internal Review Documentation and Tracking System and continues to\
      \ incorporate manual-paper based program reviews and spot-checks into automated\
      \ processes within the system.  The objectives for Internal Review Documentation\
      \ and Tracking System are to improve oversight capabilities to State and National\
      \ program managers, supplement data mining efforts and formally document review\
      \ results for program analysis and enrichment. This effort is ongoing and is\
      \ planned through fiscal year 2024. \n\nOther Infrastructures Needs - As part\
      \ of the Agency’s new integrated compliance plan, the design will incorporate\
      \ further actions to address meeting program reduction targets, including but\
      \ not limited to: 1) changing the current sampling methodology to using better\
      \ sound statistical, survey, and data collection methodologies that elevate\
      \ past issues of  “oversampling” and inefficient use of resources, while also\
      \ ensuring the program dollars are delivered to all producers who are legally\
      \ entitled to them; 2) utilizing a risk-based approach, where program risks\
      \ and risk tolerances are identified to allow the right internal controls to\
      \ be put in place, establish program metrics that gages the success of meeting\
      \ objectives and need for improvements; 3) integrating a more proactive use\
      \ of data mining to identify program key performance indicators, anomalies,\
      \ fraud, waste, and abuse; and 4) performing a validity reassessment of current\
      \ program oversight processes, such as oversight checklists, redelegation of\
      \ authorities for approvals, etc.  \n\nThese actions will also assist in capturing\
      \ program impacts to targeted arenas of the historically underserved groups\
      \ and determining where increased efforts are needed to improve accessibility\
      \ to Farm Service Agency programs and services. For example, implementing routine\
      \ sampling of denied applications on historically underserved groups to verify\
      \ if approval and disapproval decisions are being made accurately. \n\nFarm\
      \ Service Agency is also coordinating with Farm Production and Conservation\
      \ Business Center and the Department on the multi-year data management efforts\
      \ to improve transparency, data mining, intelligence dashboards, and program\
      \ analysis.  Equally, significant investments in the development and utilization\
      \ of program dashboards and visualizations have been made by Farm Service Agency.\
      \  These efforts are helping to increase transparency, augment analytics capacity\
      \ and make data readily available to support important mission-focused decision-making.\
      \  \n\nFarm Service Agency has built a number of dashboards to provide visualizations\
      \ for its major Farm Programs and Farm Loan Programs, such as Coronavirus Food\
      \ Assistance Program 1, Coronavirus Food Assistance Program 2, Wildfires and\
      \ Hurricanes Indemnity Program Plus, Dairy Margin Coverage, Agriculture Risk\
      \ Coverage and Price Loss Coverage, Conservation Reserve Program, Farm Loan\
      \ Program Direct Loan Portfolio, Farm Loan Program Loan Obligations, program\
      \ payments, acreage reporting, etc.  Nationwide administrative dashboards to\
      \ view office workload, productivity, and the geographic servicing areas for\
      \ Farm Service Agency leadership and managerial staff have also been developed\
      \ throughout fiscal year 2022.\n \n"
