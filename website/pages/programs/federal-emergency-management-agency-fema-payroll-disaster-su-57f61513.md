    pro1: 'The federal disaster workforce is designed to scale up or down depending
      on the timing and magnitude of disasters and includes Title 5, Stafford Act,
      Surge Capacity Force, and FEMA Corps employees. For the testing conducted in
      2021, FEMA’s assessment was focused on the associated FY 2019 disaster supplemental
      funding disbursements of over $334 million applicable for review under PIIA.
      For additional information on the results of this assessment, please refer to
      the FY 2021 published data on paymentaccuracy.gov.


      Based on FY 2022 reporting over FY 2020 disbursement activity, the improper
      payment rate for the program has improved and has dropped below the OMB threshold
      of $10M in estimated improper payments to be considered susceptible to significant
      improper payments.'

    rnp3: FEMA Leadership prioritizes the annual PIIA assessments and has high expectations
      of reducing IPs and UPs. FEMA Leadership stresses the importance of being a
      good steward of taxpayer dollars which is trickled down the FEMA levels of hierarchy.
      Root cause analyses are performed at the completion of PIIA testing for each
      program which are used a basis for creating the respective MAPs as well as improving
      the respective internal control environments. Overall, the IPs and UPs are decreasing.
      Additionally, FEMA will be conducting training and require routine meetings
      with stakeholders as needed.

    rnp3: 'Through the automation, training, change process, and audit efforts noted,
      FEMA is confident that the program will continue to see reduced IPs and UPs.


      FEMA continues to work through the unknown payments to classify as either proper
      or improper payments. For all overpayments that have been deemed to be recoupable,
      FEMA is moving forward with the debt collection process.'

    rap5: Program is reflective of disaster supplemental funding that was received
      by DHS to respond to the Hurricane Harvey, Irma, and Maria disasters that occurred
      in the 2017 / 2018 timeframe. Due to the burden of testing and reporting, Disaster
      Supplemental Funding programs are tested and reported two years in arrears.
      As such, by the time that remedial action is taken and/or is realized in the
      PIIA testing results, the total value of annual disbursements is expected to
      be below the threshold for PIIA action. DHS will continue to make process and
      internal control improvements to improve the payment management processes as
      it relates to supplemental funding but feels that internal control, human capital,
      information system, and infrastructure needs have been met.

      and information system and other infrastructure to reduce improper payments
      and unknown payments to the tolerable rate for the Federal Emergency Management
      Agency (FEMA) - Payroll - Disaster Supplemental Funds program.
