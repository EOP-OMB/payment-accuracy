Actions_By_Year:
  2023:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions planned regarding automation include VA will
      update the claims processing system, Electronic Claims Adjudication Management
      System, to identify and auto-deny Community Care Network claims that should
      be processed by a third party administrator. VA contracting will instruct third
      party administrators to deny out of network facility provider claims for emergent
      episodes of care. Additionally, VA will update system logic in the claims processing
      system to suspend or deny dental claims when provider criteria does not reconcile
      to the Veterans Care Agreement.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app1_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: VA has identified root causes for improper and unknown
      payments and developed effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies.
      The cause of improper payments were attributed to failure to access data/information
      and the cause of unknown payments were attributed to unable to determine whether
      proper or improper. For the Community Care Network contract, the majority of
      overpayments and underpayments occurred because the claim was not paid according
      to contract terms. For non-contract instances, the majority of unknown payments
      occurred because the explanation of benefits is not available and is required
      to determine whether or not the reimbursement amount per VA regulation is correct.
      Automation was the best mitigation strategy because overpayments resulted from
      manual processes and human error. Change process was the best mitigation strategy
      in order to develop stronger internal controls and mitigate risks within existing
      payment processes. Training was the best mitigation strategy to communicate
      the importance of consistencies in standard operating procedures.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app17_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions planned regarding change process include clarifying
      payment methodology within VA and third party administrators to bill at the
      correct allowable rates.  VA will also implement system checks for non-contract
      payments to suspend specific institutional inpatient and ambulance claims for
      manual review prior to payment. In addition, VA will instruct third party administrators
      to follow standard billing practices as defined in the contract. VA will communicate
      to claims processing agents to not process claims when timely filing requirements
      are not met.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app4_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions planned regarding training include VA will provide
      training on claims processing requirements when required other health insurance
      documentation is missing.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app3_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions taken regarding automation include verified
      that the Electronic Claims Adjudication Management System is auto denying payments
      appropriately based on authorization logic. VA worked with appropriate offices
      to correct system logic so the Electronic Claims Adjudication Management System
      auto-calculates the accurate allowable amount. In addition, VA migrated National
      Dialysis Contract claims processing to Electronic Claims Adjudication Management
      System to auto-process correct rates.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp1_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: VA has identified root causes for improper and unknown
      payments and developed effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies.
      The cause of improper payments were attributed to failure to access data/information
      and the cause of unknown payments were attributed to unable to determine whether
      proper or improper. In particular, the majority of overpayments and underpayments
      occurred because the claim was not paid according to contract terms. The majority
      of unknown payments occurred during an interim period prior to the final decision
      for appropriate payment methodology of End-Stage Renal Disease claims. Automation
      was the best mitigation strategy because improper and unknown payments resulted
      from manual processes and human error. Change process was the best mitigation
      strategy in order to develop stronger internal controls and mitigate risks within
      existing payment processes.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp17_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions taken regarding change process include updated
      internal policies, ensuring the correct rates are being paid, and timely filing
      requirements are accurately enforced in the Electronic Claims Adjudication Management
      System. VA also improved pre-payment checks in the authorization system to improve
      claims processing accuracy. In addition, VA researched why Veteran's other health
      insurance information was not present in the payment system to correct and prevent
      future deficiencies. VA also continued with the post-implementation of the MISSION
      Act. This includes moving previous non-contract claims into compliant purchasing
      vehicles such as agreements and contracts. Finally, VA documented the decision
      of whether or not to apply the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services End-Stage
      Renal Disease network reduction to VA dialysis claims.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp4_1
  2024:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions planned include ensuring contract language is
      clear and clarify any inconsistent payment methodology instances with third-party
      administrators regarding payment discrepancies. Additionally, VA will engage
      in a contract modification to further elaborate on standard episode of care
      claims processing. In addition, VA will ensure timely filing criteria is clear
      and proper monitoring is in place. Change process was the best mitigation strategy
      in order to develop stronger internal controls and mitigate risks within existing
      payment processes.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app4_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions planned include conducting post-payment reviews
      and establishing bills of collection for claims that were overpaid. These actions
      were designed to reduce overpayments attributed to failure to access data/information.
      Audit was the best mitigation strategy to help identify overpayments and perform
      a follow-up process.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app6_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions taken included updating the claims processing
      system to identify and auto-deny Community Care Network claims that should be
      processed by a third-party administrator to deny out of network facility provider
      claims for emergent episodes of care. Additionally, VA transitioned National
      Dialysis Contract claims from a legacy system to an automated claims processing
      system to ensure claims are paid at the correct rates. In addition, VA updated
      system logic in the claims processing system to suspend or deny dental claims
      when provider criteria does not reconcile to the Veterans Care Agreement. Automation
      was the best mitigation strategy because improper and unknown payments resulted
      from manual processes and human error.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp1_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions taken included clarified payment methodology
      with VA and third-party administrators to bill at the correct allowable rates.
      Additionally, for non-network payments, VA implemented system checks to suspend
      institutional inpatient, and ambulance claims for manual review prior to payment.
      In addition, VA instructed third-party administrators to follow standard billing
      practices as defined in the contract and communicated to claims processing agents
      to not process claims when timely filing requirements were not met. Change process
      was the best mitigation strategy in order to develop stronger internal controls
      and mitigate risks within existing payment processes.

    rnp4: null
  2024:
    pro1: The VA Community Care program continues to prioritize and implement effective
      corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper and unknown
      payments as evidenced by its sixth consecutive year of reductions and is expected
      to maintain compliance with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 for
      FY 2024. Specifically, from FY 2023 to FY 2024, the VA Community Care program
      decreased its improper and unknown error rate from 4.92% to 1.90% (3.02% reduction)
      and improper and unknown payments from $992.38 million to $416.63 million ($575.75
      million reduction). Given the time it takes to implement corrective actions
      and mitigation strategies, the program expects the continued positive impact
      of these actions on its FY 2025 improper and unknown payment rate.
    rnp4: This program was determined compliant in FY 2024 by the Office of Inspector
      General and reported improper and unknown payments below required thresholds
      for a compliance determination in FY 2025. In FY 2025, VA executive managers
      and program personnel will be focused on prevention and recovery of overpayments
      as appropriate. This will include various mitigation strategies such as change
      process and audit. These actions address the root causes of errors found in
      FY 2024 payment integrity testing. VA’s executive managers to include the Executive
      Director of Integrated Veteran Care and Integrated External Networks and program
      personnel will be held accountable through annual performance criteria contained
      within their performance plans. Performance criteria will be unique to and inclusive
      of all their duties. Depending on each employees’ responsibilities, duties can
      include preventing improper and unknown payments through effective internal
      controls, recovering overpayments if appropriate, and implementing remediation
      efforts for known causes of improper and unknown payments. State and local governments
      are not involved in the execution of this program.

    rnp3: VA continues to prioritize and implement effective corrective actions and
      mitigation strategies that reduce improper payments agency-wide as evidenced
      by its third consecutive and largest year of reductions. Specifically, from
      FY20 to FY21, the VA Community Care program decreased its error rate from 78.51
      percent to 16.06 percent (62.45% reduction) and improper payments from $7,476.55
      million to $2,274.69 million ($5,201.86 million reduction). Due to VA Community
      Care reporting over $100 million of overpayments/monetary loss in FY2020, the
      program was required by Office of Management and Budget to report quarterly
      on activities and accomplishments that reduce monetary loss. Those activities
      and accomplishments can be found at PaymentAccuracy.gov. VA Community Care has
      remained committed to actions that reduce monetary loss and continues to tailor
      corrective actions to reduce improper payments.

    rnp3: 'VA performed an effectiveness review in FY 2022 of the actions implemented
      in FY 2021. The purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness of
      corrective actions or mitigation strategies and whether the actions were effectively
      implemented and prioritized within the agency. The results for the VA Community
      Care program indicated that of the nine actions assessed, six were closed and
      determined to be effective in mitigating the root cause, two were closed and
      determined to be ineffective in mitigating the root cause, and one was open
      and determined to be correctly designed to mitigate the root cause. If improvements
      could be made, VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine the program''s mitigation
      strategies to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s) of error.


      For errors tied to failure to access data/information, associated corrective
      actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a total reduction in the improper
      payment amount from $2,018.02 million in FY 2020 to $1,381.62 million in FY
      2021, or a 32% reduction. For errors tied to statutory requirements of program
      were not met, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies contributed
      to a total reduction in the improper payment amount from $5,458.54 million in
      FY 2020 to $411.72 million in FY 2021, or a 92% reduction. There were no errors
      or associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies tied to unable to
      determine whether proper or improper in FY 2020.


      VA will perform an effectiveness review in FY 2023 of the corrective action
      plans implemented in FY 2022 due to the time needed to implement actions as
      well as to impact the payment process. Results of this review will be reported

  2024:
    act17_1: VA has identified root causes for improper and unknown payments and developed
      effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies. The cause of FY 2024
      improper payments were attributed to failure to access data/information. The
      majority of overpayments occurred because the claim was not received within
      the required timeframe. Automation was the best mitigation strategy because
      overpayments resulted from manual processes and human error. Change process
      was the best mitigation strategy in order to develop stronger internal controls
      and mitigate risks within existing payment processes. Training was the best
      mitigation strategy to communicate the importance of consistencies in standard
      operating procedures. Audit was the best mitigation strategy to help identify
      overpayments and perform a follow-up process.
    act17_2: VA reduced the error rate in this program from 4.92% in FY 2023 to 1.90%
      in FY 2024, resulting in a reduction of $575.75 million, by implementing effective
      corrective actions and mitigation strategies. VA's process for development of
      corrective actions and mitigation strategies ensures the severity of the error
      is considered and the action is adequate. VA's corrective actions and mitigation
      strategies have been evaluated by the Office of Inspector General during their
      FY 2024 annual audit and determined reasonable with no recommendations for improvement.
      The overpayments were attributed to VA's failure to access data/information.
      Actions taken regarding automation included updating the claims processing system
      to identify and auto-deny Community Care Network claims that should be processed
      by a third-party administrator to deny out of network facility provider claims
      for emergent episodes of care. Additionally, VA transitioned National Dialysis
      Contract claims from a legacy system to an automated claims processing system
      to ensure claims are paid at the correct rates. In addition, VA updated system
      logic in the claims processing system to suspend or deny dental claims when
      provider criteria does not reconcile to the Veterans Care Agreement. Actions
      taken regarding training included VA providing training on claims processing
      requirements when required other health insurance documentation was missing.
      Actions taken regarding change process included clarified payment methodology
      with VA and third-party administrators to bill at the correct allowable rates.
      Additionally, for non-network payments, VA implemented system checks to suspend
      institutional inpatient and ambulance claims for manual review prior to payment.
      In addition, VA instructed third-party administrators to follow standard billing
      practices as defined in the contract and communicated to claims processing agents
      to not process claims when timely filing requirements were not met. Actions
      planned regarding audit include conducting post-payment reviews and establishing
      bills of collection for claims that were overpaid. Actions planned regarding
      change process include ensuring contract language is clear and clarify any inconsistent
      payment methodology instances with third-party administrators regarding payment
      discrepancies. Additionally, VA will engage in a contract modification to further
      elaborate on standard episode of care claims processing. Finally, VA will ensure
      timely filing criteria is clear and proper monitoring is in place.
    act17_3: VA updates corrective action plans annually based on testing results,
      and no less than quarterly throughout the fiscal year, to ensure actions taken
      and planned are appropriately prioritized and designed to mitigate risks of
      improper and unknown payments. VA monitors progress and results of implementation
      on a quarterly basis. Additionally, an effectiveness review is performed annually
      to measure if an action planned has reduced or is properly designed to reduce
      improper and unknown payments for a specific root cause based on a set benchmark.
      VA identifies areas for improvement and conducted a root cause analysis to refine
      the program's mitigation strategies to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s)
      of error. The decrease in the improper payment and unknown payment rate from
      4.92% in FY 2023 to 1.90% in FY 2024, and the $575.75 million reduction in improper
      and unknown payments supports the effective implementation and prioritization
      of action within the agency. Furthermore, the annual effectiveness review process
      allows VA to create or update actions as necessary to ensure continued progress
      in the remediation of improper and unknown payments.
    rnp3: 'The VA Community Care program continues to prioritize and implement effective
      corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper and unknown

      were effective and one was designed effectively. If improvements could be made,
      VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine the program''s mitigation strategies
      to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s) of error.


      For errors tied to failure to access data/information, associated corrective
      actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a reduction in the improper
      payment amount from $959.53 million in FY 2023 to $416.63 million in FY 2024,
      or a 57% reduction. For errors tied to unable to determine whether proper or

      to a 100% reduction in the unknown payment amount from $32.85 million in FY
      2023 to $0 in FY 2024.


      VA will perform an effectiveness review in FY 2025 of the corrective action
      plans developed and implemented in FY 2024 due to the time needed to develop
      and implement actions and to impact the payment process. Results of this review

    cyp20_2: The VA Community Care reduction target is equal to the estimated future
      improper payment and unknown payment rate. VA establishes reduction targets
      by setting them lower than the current year improper and unknown payment estimates.
      Reduction targets are a balance between being aggressive and realistic. One
      thing VA has learned from the many years it has been working to comply with
      improper payments legislation is that it can take three to five years from the
      point an error cause is isolated during testing to develop a corrective action,
      implement it, and then wait for payments to be made that can then be tested
      the following year since VA tests and reports improper payments one year in
      arrears.
    rap5: 'VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
      a tolerable rate not yet being met. In March 2023, the Government Accountability
      Office acknowledged VA’s substantial reduction in improper and unknown payments
      using effective mitigation strategies and corrective actions (GAO-23-106285,
      IMPROPER PAYMENTS: Fiscal Year 2022 Estimates and Opportunities for Improvement).
      VA continues to prioritize implementing appropriate corrective actions and mitigation
      strategies and has adequate funding to implement improvements planned to internal
      controls, human capital, information systems and other infrastructure, as needed,
      over VA’s payment processing and procurement systems to continue reducing improper
      and unknown payments. VA is still actively reducing improper and unknown payments
      within its existing budget authority. VA considers the reduction of improper
      and unknown payments a critical part of its financial stewardship efforts.'
    rap6: At this time, VA is not aware of additional program needs. Therefore, VA
      has not requested additional resources to establish and maintain payment integrity.
    rtp4_2: VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
      a tolerable rate not yet being met. VA continues to identify and implement appropriate
      corrective actions and mitigation strategies to further reduce the improper
      and unknown payment rate. VA has determined these corrective actions and mitigation
      strategies do not impede the mission and can be implemented cost-effectively
      within existing budget authority.

      the payment processes and accuracy of pricing results. Additionally, system
      enhancements will improve functionality of the payment processing systems and
      allow for automation of the authorization review. These improvements will decrease

      failed to access the data/information needed to determine that a valid agreement
      was in place and/or that the provider is eligible per the contract or agreement
      covering the billed dates of services prior to issuing payment. VA is also required
      to validate that payment was made in accordance with the contract rate, billed
      services did not exceed the authorized care and were eligible per regulatory
      or contractual requirements prior to issuing payment, and that payment is made
      in the appropriate amount per regulation. For contract related instances, the
      Community Care Network contractors are also responsible for ensuring the VA
      is invoiced in accordance with the contract pricing and payment guidelines.
      The agency has the direct ability to prevent overpayments from occurring by
      improving controls in the payment processes, implementing system enhancements
      to include a prepayment check, and simplifying contract pricing. Additionally,

    cyp7_ucp4_1: VA is required to validate the appropriate reimbursement rate per
      the other health insurance information for non-contract related payments. However,
      the agency currently does not have the documentation necessary to determine
      if the payment is proper or not. Specifically, VA is not able to determine the
      correct rate without the required explanation of benefits. When the explanation
      of benefits is not available, the claim should be returned to the provider.
      The missing documentation needed will assist VA in determining whether or not
      the reimbursement amount per VA regulation is correct. For this reason, we are
      unable to conclude whether the payment is proper or improper at time of payment
      without that documentation.
    cyp8: The payments are considered unknown payments when VA had lacking or insufficient
      documentation to validate pricing. Specifically, VA was unable to determine
      the appropriate pricing due to the lack of other health insurance documentation.
      Without documentation supporting the other health insurance information for
      specific non-contract related payments, the program is unable to determine whether
      the amount paid is proper or improper.
