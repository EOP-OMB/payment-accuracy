Actions_By_Year:
  2023:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: 'There are system limitations preventing OPM from expanding
      reporting in the root causes categories table per OMB''s A-136, Financial Reporting.

      Specifically, the current IT system supporting RS does not have the granularity
      to align with the OMB root cause categories. RS was unable to properly categorize
      $85.34 million in overpayments. In prior years, RS was able to report this uncategorized
      amount under "other reason." For FY 2023, the category "other

      reason" was unavailable. As the "other" category was unavailable we placed all
      the funds in the failure to access data/information category. However, RS is
      aware of the principle causes for improper payments and they are identified
      below.

      The status of an annuitant''s death may go unreported. RS relies on annuitant''s
      family members and other sources for proof of death. The delayed receipt of
      proof and sometimes no proof of death can result in an improper payment. However,
      OPM will continue to use surveys and matches to mitigate potential improper
      payments resulting from these events. OPM conducts two matches to identify discrepancies
      that may exist between the OPM annuity roll and the Social Security Administration''s
      (SSA) pay system. The Consolidated Death Match (CDM) is compared with OPM''s
      annuity roll weekly to identify annuitants who are reported as deceased by SSA.
      The Validated Agency Match System processes the death information in order to
      terminate Federal benefits and prevent subsequent improper payments. Collection
      actions are initiated for any overpayments that are discovered. The SSA Death
      Master File (DMF) match is conducted yearly and is also compared with OPM''s
      annuity roll and the SSA Death Master File (DMF). In FY 2023, Retirement Services
      collected $208.5 million in improper payments.'

  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: 'OPM’s annuity calculations have automated and manual
      components. The manual components are subject to human error. Errors can include
      entering incorrect effective dates, salary rates, and/or tours of duty, which
      all impact annuity calculations. Identifying specific skill gaps and developing
      target training

      improves accuracy which affects improper payments.'

      \ File and the Consolidated Death Match. \n\nIn addition, the Quality Assurance\
      \ Group will continue to provide feedback through monthly and  formal quarterly\
      \ reports with recommendations, if applicable. These reports will provide specific\
      \ analysis meant to discover trends that may not be discernible in any given\
      \ month. The information gained through these audits will be used to make informed\

      The Retirement Services Quality Assurance (QA) performed audits of newly adjudication
      CSRS and FERS retiree and survivor claims to assess accuracy rates and the corresponding
      value of improper payments. These audits included detailed descriptions of the
      improper payment causes. Management shared the results of the audits with employees
      for training purposes. There are system limitations preventing OPM from expanding
      reporting in the root causes categories in OMB''s A-136, Financial reporting.
      Specifically, the current IT system supporting RS does not have the ability

    Mitigation_Strategy: atp17_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: Regular quality assurance audits were used to assess
      the accuracy of annuity payments. These audits were used to identify specific
      training needs and systemic deficiencies. For example, QA conducted an audit
      on claims processed, identified a training need, and subsequently provided targeted
      training to improve accuracy. The staff that completes the specific workload
      increased their knowledge base which impacts internal accuracy goals.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp3_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: 'RS is aware of the improper payments; however, systemic
      limitations prevent RS from providing the needed level of specificity. OPM’s
      systems were not designed or built to perform analyses of vast quantities of
      data. Therefore, based on OMB''s predetermined root cause categories, only the
      category "failure to access data" applies. There are overpayments within the
      agency’s control that are are the result of annuitant''s family members and
      other sources failing to report annuitant''s death. The overpayments are considered
      to be within the agency''s control because RS has access to the death master
      file but does not

      access for each recurring payment. However, as our on-going internal control
      activities, OPM conducts surveys and matches to mitigate potential improper
      payments resulting from these events. OPM conducts two matches to identify discrepancies
      that may exist between the OPM annuity roll and the Social Security Administration’s

      and is also compared with OPM’s annuity roll and the SSA Death Master File (DMF).
      OPM also utilizes Treasury''s Do Not Pay Portal to identify annuitants that
      should have been reported as deceased. Using these mechanisms, in FY 2023 Retirement
      Services collected $208.5 million in improper payments.'
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp6_1
  2024:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: OPM’s annuity calculations involve both automated and
      manual components, the latter being susceptible to human error. Mistakes can
      arise from incorrect entries of effective dates, salary rates, or tours of duty,
      all of which impact annuity calculations. Identifying specific skill gaps and
      developing targeted training can enhance accuracy and reduce improper payments.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app3_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: 'RS plans to use Death Record Confidence Scoring Tool
      (DRCST).  Which is an automated process that matches data from the Death Master
      File with the Consolidated Death Match. Furthermore, the Quality Assurance Group
      will maintain feedback through monthly and quarterly reports, offering recommendations
      as needed. These reports will include specific analyses to uncover trends that
      may not be immediately apparent, allowing for informed resource decisions and
      ensuring compliance with policies governing benefit determinations and payments.


      The Death Record Confidence Scoring Tool (DRC Scoring Tool) is a product used
      to identify payments at risk of being issued to a deceased payee.  The DRC Scoring
      Tool converts information into a confidence score based on the likelihood the
      individual is truly deceased. The Office of Payment Integrity at the Department
      of Treasury then uses the confidence score in combination with payment information
      within the customer’s dataset to identify the records that have the greatest
      potential impact for at-risk dollars.'
    Mitigation_Strategy: app6_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: Regular quality assurance audits assess the accuracy
      of annuity payments, identifying training needs and systemic deficiencies. For
      instance, targeted training based on audit findings has enhanced staff knowledge
      and improved accuracy. However, systemic limitations hinder RS from providing
      specific data analysis, with overpayments largely attributed to failures in
      reporting annuitant deaths.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp3_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: RS acknowledges the occurrence of improper payments;
      however, systemic limitations hinder the provision of detailed specificity.
      OPM's systems were not designed to analyze large data sets. Consequently, based
      on OMB's established root cause categories, only "failure to access data" is
      applicable. Overpayments within the agency’s purview result from family members
      or other sources failing to report an annuitant's death. These overpayments
      are deemed under the agency’s control because RS has access to the Do Not Pay
      file but is unable to search Do Not Pay prior to each recurring payment. Nevertheless,
      OPM engages in ongoing internal control activities, including surveys and data
      matching, to reduce potential improper payments from these occurrences. OPM
      performed the Consolidated Death Match (CDM) to identify discrepancies between
      the OPM annuity roll and the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) pay system.
      This weekly match helps identify annuitants reported deceased by the SSA, while
      the Validated Agency Match System processes death information to terminate federal
      benefits and prevent further improper payments. Collection actions are initiated
      for any discovered overpayments.  Additionally, OPM utilizes the Treasury's
      Do Not Pay Portal to identify annuitants who should have been reported deceased.

    cyp2_1: Overpayments within the agency’s control are generally the result of antiquated
      systems that fail to automate the processing of available intra-agency data
      while the payments are being processed. Additionally, the outdated systems fail
      to provide large quantities of specific data in order to pinpoint risk areas
      of improper payments. For example, overpayments occurred because the death data
      isn’t directly linked to the payment file to allow for immediate suspension
      of accounts. The overpayments are considered to be within the agency’s control
      because RS has access to the death data. The agency has put measures in place
      to mitigate improper payments to include annuitant surveys sent electronically
      or by mail to solicit eligibility. It also conducts a Consolidated Death Match
      (CDM), comparing the annuity roll to the full death master file from SSA on
      a weekly cadence, suspending and dropping accounts on the list that fail to
      respond to notices. The agency also utilizes Bureau of Fiscal Services’ Do Not
      Pay (DNP) portal, conducting monthly searches of annuitants who are reported
      as deceased through the death data sources (i.e. EVVE-FOD, DOD, DOS, AIS-OBIT,
      AIS-PROB, PACER, DMF-Public), verifying death and stopping further payments.

    cyp2_1: 'Overpayments within the agency''s control typically stem from outdated
      systems that do not automate the processing of available intra-agency data during
      payment processing. These antiquated systems lack the capability to provide
      comprehensive data necessary for identifying risk areas related to improper
      payments. For instance, overpayments often occur because death data is not directly
      linked to the payment file, preventing immediate account suspensions. Although
      the agency has access to this death data, overpayments are still considered
      within our control.  To mitigate improper payments, the agency employs several
      measures, including: Annuitant Surveys: These are sent electronically or by
      mail to verify eligibility.   Do Not Pay (DNP) Portal: Monthly searches are
      performed to verify deaths reported through various sources (e.g., EVVE-FOD,
      DOD, DOS) to prevent further payments.'
