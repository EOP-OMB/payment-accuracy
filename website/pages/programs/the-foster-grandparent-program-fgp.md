  2023:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Utilizing improper and unknown payments information
      from AmeriCorps’ annual Payment Integrity Assessment, the working group will
      identify the root cause drivers behind the improper and unknown payments. Based
      on this information, the group will implement a plan of action steps aimed at
      reducing these areas of non-compliance. The training and resources will focus
      on the identified improper payment root cause drivers. The agency also provided
      resolution packets to grantees at the conclusion of the FY 2022 assessment linking
      specific root cause drivers of improper payments to the corresponding applicable
      statute, regulation, and available trainings. This will continue for the FY
      2023 assessment.

  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: AmeriCorps plans to continue to provide training and
      resources to grantees to ensure proper utilization of grant funds. AmeriCorps
      has a Payment Integrity Corrective Action Plan working group that includes accountable
      program officials and key agency stakeholders. The working group has created
      training and resources targeted at the root cause drivers of improper payments
      which are available on the agency’s website or grantee training platform (LITMOS).
      The working group plans to analyze the FY 2023 improper payments root cause
      drivers and explore opportunities to create new resources or expand on those
      that currently exist in FY 2024.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app3_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: Regarding the provision of training as a corrective
      action, AmeriCorps established a Payment Integrity Corrective Action Plan working
      group in FY 2022 to identify corrective actions the agency could take to address
      its improper payment rate. Utilizing improper and unknown payment information
      from AmeriCorps’ annual Payment Integrity Assessment, the working group identified
      the root cause drivers behind the improper and unknown payments. Based on this
      information, the group implemented a plan of action steps aimed at reducing
      these areas of non-compliance. The training and resources focus on the identified
      improper payment root cause drivers. The agency also provided resolution packets
      to grantees at the conclusion of the FY 2022 assessment linking specific root
      cause drivers of improper payments to the corresponding applicable statute,
      regulation, and available training. This will continue for the FY 2023 assessment.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp17_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: AmeriCorps had established a Payment Integrity Corrective
      Action Plan working group. Using improper and unknown payments information from
      AmeriCorps’ annual Payment Integrity Assessment, the working group has identified
      the root cause drivers behind the improper and unknown payments. Based on this
      information, the group has created resources and delivered training focused
      on the identified improper payment root cause drivers. Those trainings were
      available to grantees for FY 2023. The agency also provided resolution packets
      to grantees at the conclusion of the FY 2022 assessment, linking specific root
      cause drivers of improper payments to the corresponding applicable statute,
      regulation, and available training. This will continue for the FY 2023 assessment.

  2024:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: AmeriCorps had previously established a Payment Integrity
      Corrective Action Plan working group. This group will be revived in FY 2025
      analyzing the latest payment integrity results and determining the best actions
      to reduce rates. Additionally, AmeriCorps has developed an internal control
      for grantees trainings that will be required in the FY 2025 terms and conditions.
      AmeriCorps will develop specific required remediations for grantees with identical
      year over year findings.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app3_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: The agency currently has two vendors that provide different
      required National Service Criminal History Checks. The agency will move to one
      contracted vendor that can provide compliant National Service Criminal History
      Checks. This will be a new, streamlined process for grantees.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app4_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: AmeriCorps had previously established a Payment Integrity
      Corrective Action Plan working group to address improper payment rates. This
      group identified the root cause drivers behind the improper and unknown payments.
      Based on this information, the group has created resources and delivered trainings
      focused on the identified improper payment root cause drivers. Those trainings
      are and have been available to grantees.  The agency also provided resolution
      packets to grantees at the conclusion of the FY 2024 assessment linking specific
      root cause drivers of improper payments to the corresponding applicable statute,
      regulation, and available trainings. This will continue for the FY 2025 assessment.

    rnp4: The agency implemented an improper payment reduction corrective action plan
      group to develop actions to reduce the improper payments and this group will
      be reinstated in FY 2025. This group consisted of representatives from offices
      across the agency. Through root cause analysis and corrective action plan development,
      the agency is assessing where additional controls may be necessary to reduce
      improper payments. The improper payments reported for the agency are made at
      the grantee level, therefore the agency is developing an internal control training
      to strengthen the control environment at the grantee level. Executive managers,
      programs, and other staff contribute to improper payment corrective action planning.
      Reduction in improper payments may be included in performance conversations
      for those accountable for the reduction.

      loss to the government. The majority are unknown payments for which the agency’s
      grantees are unable to provide sufficient support documentation to determine
      if the payment was proper or improper. Since the agency does not have direct
      control over the payments, it is implanting updated, comprehensive trainings
      to ensure the grantees have the requisite knowledge to appropriately support
      their payments. The agency has elevated the reduction of improper payments to
      be a key performance indicator in its strategic plan.

  2024:
    act17_1: "The internal control training will target root causes in both unknown\
      \ and overpayment categories to address adequate record keeping and controls\
      \ to ensure payments are correct and correctly recorded. \n\nRegarding the provision\
      \ of training as a corrective action, AmeriCorps will reestablish the Payment\

      \ The training and resources focus on the identified improper payment root cause\
      \ drivers. \n"
    act17_2: Program participant and payment eligibility decisions are made at the
      grantee level. It is essential that grantees have access to training and resources
      that provide information on financial grants management. Having effective and
      readily available resources to guide grantees in program implementation promotes
      effective stewardship of federal funds and reduce non-compliance.  The created
      resources build upon the agency’s currently available tools and focus specifically
      on areas of non-compliance. Additional actions will be taken given AmeriCorps
      still reports rates over $10M and/or 10%.
    act17_3: As part of its strategic plan, AmeriCorps is prioritizing effective stewardship
      of federal resources. This goal includes the objective of reducing the agency’s
      improper payments via an agency-wide corrective action plan. The prior establishment
      of the working group represents a coordinated effort by the agency to develop
      and implement corrective actions aimed at reducing improper payments. The agency
      performs root cause analysis to determine why improper payments are occurring
      at the grantee level. This allows for more targeted actions.

    cyp15: 'Yes'
    cyp20_2: The reduction target equals the estimated future IP and UP rates. The
      agency assumes flat funding for the current year +1 estimate, so the reduction
      target was used to calculate IP and UPs. The corrective actions implemented
      in FY22 that may reduce the future rates are targeting unknown payments, therefore
      that is where the reduction can be seen.
    rap5: As part of its strategic plan, AmeriCorps is prioritizing effective stewardship
      of federal resources. This goal includes the objective of reducing the agency’s
      improper payments via five-pronged approach. Via the strategic plan that agency
      is committing resources – human capital, internal controls, and information
      systems, to reduce improper payments.

      and Unknown Payments. The corrective actions developed in FY 2022, including
      enhanced training, may further reduce the future rates targeting unknown payments.

    cyp20_2: The reduction target is less than the estimated future IP and UP rates.
      The agency assumes flat funding for the current year +1 estimate, so the reduction
      target was used to calculate IP and UPs. Since the payments that AmeriCorps’
      tests are in the prior and only part of the current fiscal year, there is a
      delay in seeing the effects of any implemented corrective actions. The including
      enhanced trainings and resolution packets provided to grantees with improper
      payments may further reduce the future rates.
