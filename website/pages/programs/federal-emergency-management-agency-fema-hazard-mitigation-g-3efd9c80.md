  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: "FEMA will continue to execute and enhance the Hazard\
      \ Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) as necessary, to include updates to policy\
      \ and procedural documentation as applicable. \n\nIn addition, FEMA will continue\
      \ to provide regular training opportunities for regional partners and state,\
      \ local, tribal, and territorial governments. Training is specifically tailored\
      \ to each audience and will continue to range from webinar recordings to on-demand\
      \ workshops. Training offered through the Emergency Management Institute will\
      \ also continue to offer self-paced courses, with a certificate of completion\
      \ provided at the end. By continuing to train relevant parties and stakeholders,\
      \ FEMA can continue to sustain and enhance program performance going forward,\
      \ including the assurance that sufficient documentation is readily available."

    Description_Action_Taken: "The National Emergency Management Information System\
      \ (NEMIS) is a database system used to track disaster data for FEMA and recipient\
      \ emergency management offices. NEMIS supports emergency management at a disaster\
      \ site and enables FEMA to integrate mitigation and planning operations with\
      \ FEMA programs and disaster assistance. NEMIS enables data to be coordinated\
      \ throughout a disaster, from monitoring an incident to providing assistance\
      \ to communities affected by a disaster. \n\nThe NEMIS HMGP System is the Mitigation\
      \ module of NEMIS. This module provides a way to administer HMGP information\
      \ and grant applications. It interacts with some of the other NEMIS modules\
      \ such as Declaration, Preliminary Damage Assessment, and Emergency Support.\
      \ The NEMIS HMGP System can track project applications through workflow processes\
      \ and work packets. For each task in a workflow process, the system generates\
      \ a work packet. Users access the work packet to accomplish the steps in the\
      \ process. The NEMIS HMGP System executes work packets and workflow to assist\
      \ in automating the Eligibility Determination, Project Review and Approval,\
      \ Application Review and Approval, etc."

    Description_Action_Taken: As the FEMA Hazard Mitigation Grant Program - Disaster
      Supplemental Funds program error rate is solely driven by unknown payments,
      the agency remains committed to obtaining sufficient documentation at the time
      of payment as well as in a timely manner to assess the appropriateness of such
      payments. Because the recipients manage the award and subawards provided to
      their subrecipients, FEMA has documented and reiterated the current recipient
      responsibilities in the updated Hazard Mitigation Assistance Program and Policy
      Guide (HMA Guide), effective March 2023. These responsibilities include monitoring
      activities, reviewing financial and progress reports, submitting quarterly reports
      to FEMA, verifying that every subrecipient is audited, and perform on-site reviews
      or other monitoring activities as appropriate while taking enforcement action
      against non-compliant subrecipients.

    Description_Action_Taken: 'Trainings are available and are designed to help FEMA
      regional partners and state, local, tribal, and territorial governments create
      effective hazard mitigation plans that meet FEMA’s requirements and reduce risk
      in their communities. Training is specifically tailored to each audience. Additionally,
      several advanced trainings and technical assistance related to pertinent areas
      in hazard mitigation assistance are available. These range from webinar recordings
      to on-demand workshops.


      FEMA continues to provide both classroom and online independent study courses
      for staff, as well as state, local, territorial, and tribal government employees
      to register for training through the Emergency Management Institute or through
      their State Mitigation Officer.


      The Emergency Management Institute serves as the national focal point for the
      development and delivery of emergency management training to enhance the capabilities
      of federal, state, local, tribal and territorial government officials, volunteer
      organizations and the public and private sectors to minimize the impact of disasters.
      Training classes through the Emergency Management Institute offer self-paced
      courses, with a certificate of completion provided at the end.'

  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: Effective March 2023, FEMA released the updated Hazard
      Mitigation Assistance Program and Policy Guide (HMA Guide).  The purpose of
      the HMA Guide is to outline the policy and procedural requirements of FEMA’s
      mitigation grant programs over the lifecycle of a project or activity. The 2023
      HMA Guide update incorporates existing policies and guidance materials issued
      since 2015, simplifies and clarifies guidance, and incorporates strategic mitigation
      priorities.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp4_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: 'The Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA)
      requires agencies to review and assess all programs and activities they administer
      and identify those determined to be susceptible to significant improper payments,
      estimate the annual amount of improper payments, and submit those estimates
      to Congress. In accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular
      A-123, Appendix C, Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement, federal agencies
      are required to assess improper payments and report annually on their efforts.
      As a result of the testing procedures performed on the statistical sample of
      payments, FEMA identified minimal errors in the HMGP – Disaster Supplemental
      Funds program selected samples. Based on the extrapolated results, the program
      is not susceptible to significant improper payments as the estimated results
      are below both the 1.5% error rate and the $10M error amount thresholds established
      by OMB.


      In addition, FEMA performed an assessment of internal control over financial
      reporting including performing tests of operating effectiveness, for the FY
      2023 performance period. These internal control assessments included a review
      over Grants Management with no significant or material internal control issues
      arising related to HMGP.'

      is available after a presidentially declared disaster.


      For the testing conducted in 2022, FEMA’s assessment was focused on the associated
      FY 2020 disaster supplemental funding disbursements. As this is the first year
      in testing, the program has not yet been considered baselined by DHS and will

      policies and trainings. If a transaction is deemed technically improper then
      the transaction is submitted through our debt collection process including Notice
      of Potential Debt Letters and Treasury Offset if applicable. In FY 23, FEMA
      will conduct periodic status meetings to make sure all parties are tracking
      and resolving improper payments through its remediation process.

      FEMA conducted testing over the FY 2021 disbursements made by the Hazard Mitigation
      Grant Program - Disaster Supplemental Funds program between October 2022 and
      September 2023. During that review period, FEMA was unable to obtain sufficient
      documentation for three (3) transaction samples, related to Georgia and the
      U.S. Virgin Islands, out of the total sample size of 129 transactions. This
      inhibited FEMA''s ability to fully ascertain whether the payment for these specific
      transactions was proper or improper. These sample results were then extrapolated
      to the entire program population in accordance with the DHS statistical methodology.'
