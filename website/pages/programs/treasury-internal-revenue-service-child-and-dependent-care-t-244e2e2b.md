  rac3: The Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) became refundable only for
    Tax Year (TY) 2021, under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA), as part
    of the COVID-19 pandemic assistance programs. The changes to the CDCTC were temporary,
    applying only to TY 2021. The short-term nature of this program limits the IRS’s
    ability to calculate improper payment estimates. To generate an improper payment
    estimate, the IRS needs to conduct comprehensive audits over a large sample of
    tax returns, requiring at least three years’ worth of data to ensure accuracy.
    However, because ARPA’s changes to the CDCTC were limited to TY 2021, there isn’t
    enough time or data to create an estimate before the refundable nature of this
    program ends. Accordingly, the credit has no basis for improper payment estimates.
    In August 2022 Treasury determined that due to the short-term nature of these
    programs, quantifying the amount and rate of improper payments, assessing the
    root cause, and developing corrective action plans to reduce payment errors in
    the future would provide minimal value and be an ineffective use of resources.
    Therefore, for its COVID-19 pandemic relief programs Treasury decided it would
    not report an improper payment estimate either in its Agency Financial Report
    or on paymentaccuracy.gov. However, these programs will remain on the three-year
    risk assessment rotation.
