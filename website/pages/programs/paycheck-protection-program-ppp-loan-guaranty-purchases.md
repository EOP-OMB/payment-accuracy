  2024:
    pro1: "The CARES Act established the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans to\
      \ provide economic relief to small businesses and incentivize small businesses\
      \ to keep their workers on the payroll because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The\
      \ SBA separated PPP into three payment integrity reporting categories – PPP\
      \ Approvals, PPP Forgiveness, and PPP Purchases.  PPP ended in May 2021.  Although\
      \ no new PPP funds are being disbursed, borrowers may still request forgiveness\
      \ for a PPP loan and lenders may request guaranty purchase of a PPP loan.  SBA\
      \ is reporting under PIIA on these aspects of the program.\nIf a PPP loan is\
      \ not forgiven, the SBA may purchase (honor) all or part of the PPP loan guaranty.\
      \ Lenders may request that the SBA purchase the guaranty of a PPP loan in the\
      \ event of a default or other qualifying event.  A lender must have made certain\
      \ certifications about the loan and supporting information. The SBA reviews\
      \ the lender’s request for guaranty purchase and charge-off in accordance with\
      \ PPP Loan Program Requirements. The SBA will honor its guaranty and will purchase\
      \ 100 percent of the outstanding balance of the loan provided that the lender\
      \ has complied with all PPP Loan Program Requirements.\n\nPPP Loan Guaranty\
      \ Purchase requests were submitted via SBA’s PPP platform and, although the\
      \ lenders were required to retain supporting documentation, they were not required\
      \ to submit that documentation to the SBA. The SBA requested documentation from\
      \ lenders for those guaranty purchases that were a part of the sample.  PPP\
      \ guaranty purchase samples were reviewed to determine whether the lender was\
      \ eligible to receive a loan guaranty payment; whether the lender received required\
      \ borrower certifications; and, whether the PPP loan met all statutory, regulatory,\
      \ and internal requirements for payment.  \n\n"
    rnp4: Review standards are established as part of the agency's annual  appraisal
      process.  These standards hold managers accountable  for meeting applicable
      reduction targets, preventing improper payments, and promptly detecting and
      recovering overpayments.

      the overall management of the Improper Payment program.
  2024:
    act17_1: Demanding repayment from the lender is the first step in the recovery
      process.  To recover PPP Loan Guaranty improper payments, the SBA will use processes
      similar to the process used for its 7(a) guaranty purchase portfolio, which
      begin with demanding repayment from the lender.
    act17_2: Effective corrective actions address the root cause of the overpayments.  The
      predominate reasons for improper payments in PPP Loan Guaranty Purchases were
      (1) lender’s failure to verify that the borrower was in business on February
      20, 2020; lender’s failure to verify average monthly payroll; and, unacceptable
      or missing identification of the borrower.  To recover the SBA will use processes

      and Unknown Payments.
    rap6: No additional resources for this program were requested.
    rtp4_2: The CARES Act established the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans
      to provide economic relief to small businesses and incentivize small businesses
      to keep their workers on the payroll because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Funding
      for this program ended in 2021, with no new funds advanced.  As PPP loan guaranties
      are purchased, outstanding PPP loans will eventually be reduced to a nominal
      amount. Because of this, no tolerable rate has been established.

    cyp20_2: SBA has set a reduction target for PPP Loan Guaranty Purchase  at 10.0
      percent, the statutory limit, for FY2025.  Meeting this reduction target will
      also bring this program into compliance with the Payment Integrity Information
      Act (PIIA).

      and information system and other infrastructure to reduce improper payments
      and unknown payments to the reduction target.
    rap6: The agency has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human capital
      and information system and other infrastructure to reduce improper payments
      and unknown payments to the tolerable rate.
    rtp4_2: SBA has not established a tolerable rate for PPP Loan Guaranty Purchases
      as loans under the PPP are no longer being made.  With each PPP loan guaranty
      purchase, the program gets smaller and smaller.

    cyp2_1: PPP Loan Guaranty Purchase payments are reviewed after the guaranty has
      been paid to the lender.   Borrower and lender documentation is reviewed to
      determine whether the lender is eligible, and whether the amount of guaranty
      purchase request equaled the amount in SBA systems.  SBA also verifies that
      the lender received borrower certifications, including whether the borrower
      had been in business on or around February 20, 2020.  SBA also checked that
      the eligible payroll was accurately accounted for.

    cyp8: In response to the FY 2023 PIIA Compliance Audit conducted by OIG, the SBA
      separated PPP into three payment integrity reporting categories – PPP Approvals,
      PPP Forgiveness, and PPP Purchases, and subsequently initiated the improper
      payments review process shortly after. SBA generated the loan sample and requested
      supporting documentation from lenders. In many instances, PPP loans guaranty
      purchase requests were submitted via SBA’s PPP platform and, although the lenders
      were required to retain supporting documentation, they were not required to
      submit that documentation to SBA.  SBA requested documentation from lenders
      for those guaranty purchases that were a part of the sample, with the added
      instruction to submit the documentation as soon as possible. As a result of
      the compressed time between documentation requests and reporting improper payment
      rates, many lenders were unable to provide complete documentation. Those PPP
      loans with documentation requests outstanding were categorized as “Unknown”
      payments since SBA did not have sufficient supporting documentation to make
      a determination as to whether the guaranty purchase payments were proper or
      improper.
