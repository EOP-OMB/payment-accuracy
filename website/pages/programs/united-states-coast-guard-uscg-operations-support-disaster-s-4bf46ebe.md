    pro1: 'As the Nation’s maritime first responder, the Coast Guard has unique capabilities,
      capacity, and authorities that allow it to play a critical role in disaster
      response. For each of the Hurricanes noted and all-natural disasters along our
      coastline, Coast Guard crews are typically the first federal responders to enter
      an impacted area, right alongside the state, local, tribal, and territorial
      responders, to conduct rescues and assess damage. In addition to search and
      rescue operations, the Coast Guard flows forces into the impacted regions to
      restore ports and waterways, respond to pollution, provide security and additional
      law enforcement capability where necessary, and protect offshore petrochemical
      platforms.


      For the testing conducted in 2021, USCG’s assessment was focused on the associated
      FY 2019 disaster supplemental funding disbursements of over $15 million applicable
      for review under PIIA.  For additional information on the results of this assessment,
      please refer to the FY 2021 published data on paymentaccuracy.gov.


      Although FY 2020 and FY 2021 disbursement totals related to the Supplemental
      Appropriations remained above $10M, based on Phase 2 statistical testing performed
      with results published in FY 2020 (over FY 2018 disbursements) and FY 2021 (over
      FY 2019 disbursements) indicated that the program was not susceptible to significant
      improper payments. In accordance with OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C guidance,
      DHS has determined that the program has been baselined and has converted the
      program back to Phase 1 for FY 2022 reporting based on the quantitative results
      of the testing as further confirmed by the comprehensive risk assessment completed
      in the current year.'

      are necessary to reduce improper payments. Results are reflective that actions
      and internal controls applied have been sufficient.

    rap5: Program is reflective of disaster supplemental funding that was received
      by DHS to respond to the Hurricane Harvey, Irma, and Maria disasters that occurred
      in the 2017 / 2018 timeframe. Due to the burden of testing and reporting, Disaster
      Supplemental Funding programs are tested and reported two years in arrears.
      As such, by the time that remedial action is taken and/or is realized in the
      PIIA testing results, the total value of annual disbursements is expected to
      be below the threshold for PIIA action. DHS will continue to make process and
      internal control improvements to improve the payment management processes as
      it relates to supplemental funding but feels that internal control, human capital,
      information system, and infrastructure needs have been met.
