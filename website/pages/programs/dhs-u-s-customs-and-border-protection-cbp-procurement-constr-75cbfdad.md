  pro1: 'Due to the expanse and extent of damage tied to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma,
    and Maria, many CBP facilities suffered damage. Disaster Supplemental Funding
    received addresses facility reconstitution costs due to damage incurred, primarily
    to facilities located in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.


    For the testing conducted in 2023, CBP’s assessment was focused on the associated
    FY 2021 disaster supplemental funding disbursements of over $10 million applicable
    for review under PIIA. Per the Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief
    Requirements, 2017 (P.L. 115-56, the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for
    Disaster Relief Requirements Act of 201 7 (P.L. 11572), and the Further Additional
    Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-123);
    in FY 2021, the program disbursed more than $10M in disaster supplemental funding.
    As such, the program is publishing an improper payment estimate over this disbursement
    activity in 2023.


    As this is the first year that testing has been conducted and reported for the
    CBP – Procurements, Construction, and Improvement – Disaster Supplemental Funds
    program, a second consecutive year of testing is expected to be completed with
    results published in 2024. DHS is confident that the program will continue to
    publish payment integrity results that remain below the OMB Circular A-123, Appendix
    C guidance threshold to be considered susceptible to significant improper payments.'
  rap5: As indicated by the publication of no identified improper payments and/or
    unknown payments, the program has sufficiently proven that it is being executed
    with strong internal controls and sufficient human capital, information system,
    and infrastructure support. With no substantial changes to the program anticipated,
    CBP is confident that the current resourcing and internal control environment
    relevant to the Procurement, Construction, And Improvements - Disaster Supplemental
    Funds program will remain adequate to prevent and/or reduce improper payments
    and unknown payments.

  cyp20_2: The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Procurement, Construction,
    and Improvements (PC&I) – Disaster Supplemental Funds program completed a census
    review approach to review the fiscal year (FY) 2021 and FY 2022 disbursement activity.
    As such, all disbursement activity was reviewed. Results indicated no Improper
    Payments (IPs) or Unknown Payments (UPs). Overall, DHS believes that the Office
    of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-123, Appendix C guidance threshold
    of 1.5 percent, used to determine program susceptibility for significant improper
    payments, to be tolerable for the program and thus both the tolerable rate and
    reduction target have been set to 1.5 percent. However, as the CBP PC&I - Disaster
    Supplemental Funds program has identified or reported IPs and UPs below the OMB
    Circular No. A-123, Appendix C guidance thresholds to be considered susceptible
    to significant improper payments for two consecutive years, the program has baselined
    and is expected to revert back to Phase 1 for the 2025 reporting cycle. Also,
    as the program disbursement level continues to fall, as soon as the annual disbursement
    level drops below $10 million, the program will no longer be subject to Payment
    Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) reporting requirements.

    reviewed. As indicated by the publication of no identified improper payments and/or
    unknown payments, the program has sufficiently proven that it is being executed
    with strong internal controls and sufficient human capital, information system,

  rnp4: "Department-wide, Component managers are responsible for completing internal\
    \ control work on payment processing as part of the Department’s Office of Management\
    \ and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-123 efforts. They are further responsible for\
    \ establishing and maintaining sufficient internal controls, including a control\
    \ environment that prevents improper payments from being made, effectively managing\
    \ improper payment risks, and promptly detecting and recovering any improper payments\
    \ that may occur. Management’s efforts, to include within DHS Headquarters as\
    \ well Components, around improper payments are subject to an annual compliance\
    \ review by the DHS’s Office of Inspector General (OIG). These measures are designed\
    \ to hold the appropriate personnel accountable for meeting applicable improper\
    \ payment reduction targets and establishing and maintaining strong internal controls\
    \ around payment management. \n\nDepartment-wide, the goals and requirements for\
    \ strong payment integrity are communicated to all levels of staff throughout\
    \ the DHS Office of the Chief Financial Officer and to relevant program office\
    \ and procurement staff. The Department has taken extensive measures to ensure\
    \ that managers, accountable officers, to include Component Chief Financial Officers\
