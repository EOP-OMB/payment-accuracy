      error since the COVID pandemic, when all meals were served free regardless of
      family income. Now that schools have returned to using the National School Lunch
      (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP) for determining household eligibility,
      serving healthy, nutritious meals, and claiming reimbursement for those meals,
      FNS is especially interested in Access, Participation, Eligibility, and Certification
      (APEC) IV's results to help understand current NSLP/SBP operations as opposed
      to using pre-COVID improper payment baseline.

      (CN) State agencies to improve Information Technology (IT) systems. FNS continues
      its work with grant recipients who are using funds to develop, improve, maintain
      CN IT systems.


      Data Validation Service (DVS)

      Encourage state agency adoption of FNS-developed data validation service

      FNS modified its process of reviewing state agency management of the National
      School Lunch Program (NSLP) to encourage adoption of a FNS-developed tool to
      reduce error in the reporting of NSLP administrative data. The tool, the DVS
      is an Application Programming Interface (API) that States can include in their
      platforms for collecting data from their school districts. The DVS provides
      real-time edit checks and error messages to school districts as they submit
      data to their States.'

    Description_Action_Taken: 'Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) Expansion

      Through a rulemaking effective October 26, 2023, the Food and Nutrition Service
      (FNS) lowered the eligibility threshold for school participation in the CEP
      from an Identified Student Percentage (ISP) of 40% to 25%. FNS research shows
      that schools participating in CEP have notably lower certification error than
      schools that do not participate. Based on these findings, FNS expects that increased
      CEP eligibility will correspond with a rise in CEP participation, a reduction
      in certification error, and a reduction in improper payments. Because the rule
      was published after the CEP election date for School Year (SY) 2023-2024, we
      expect that the full magnitude of decreases in improper payments resulting from
      this change will not fully be observed until SY2024-2025.  FNS released supporting
      guidance material, including a fact sheet, published February, 2024.


      Progress on Access, Participation, Eligibility, and Certification (APEC) IV

      FNS is engaged in research related to integrity in the National School Lunch
      Program(NSLP)/School Breakfast Program (SBP). APEC IV has completed data collection
      and will soon move on to analyzing data to establish an NSLP/SBP improper payment
      (IP) rate. With this update to the APEC study series, FNS will be able to use
      a new baseline estimate for IP in NSLP and SBP, improving our projected error
      rates by starting with a more recent, more accurate starting point. The study
      also includes a component that examines integrity features of online applications.
      From this sub-study, FNS aims to gain clarity on quality of data collected in
      online applications used by students and families who apply for free and reduced-price
      meals.


      Child Nutrition (CN) Integrity Rule

      FNS expects the rule’s provisions to strengthen the administration of CN programs
      at all levels, through enhanced oversight and enforcement tools designed to
      help FNS and State administering agencies to reduce program error of all types,
      resulting in more efficient operations and improved compliance with program
      requirements. Of particular importance to the NSLP and SBP, the rule allows
      states to adopt a 5-year administrative review cycle for School Food Authorities
      (SFAs); previously States reviewed SFAs a minimum of once every three years.
      States that adopt a review cycle longer than three years must establish and
      apply risk-based criteria to select SFAs for targeted follow-up reviews. This
      change allows States to direct limited resources where attention is needed most.  FNS
      released guidance on the updated review cycle December, 2023.


      The rule also formalizes a framework for developing, testing, and introducing
      integrity-focused process improvements to address IP challenges that cannot
      be remedied through monitoring alone.


      Direct Certification with Medicaid Demonstration (DC-M)

      FNS approved 5 new states to participate in the DC-M Projects for school year
      (SY) 2024-2025. Once the 5 new states implement the DC-M matching, the total
      number of states participating in DC-M will be 43. FNS research confirms that
      participation in DC-M improves program integrity by replacing the traditional
      household application for school meal benefits with an automated data match
      against existing household income records.

    pro1: Beginning March 2020, School Food Authorities (SFAs) had the option to adopt
      waivers that allowed them to serve free meals to all participants through the
      National School Lunch Program's Seamless Summer Option (SSO) or the Summer Food
      Service Program (SFSP) without the need for applications. FNS recognizes that
      Stage Agency's and SFAs need additional support and flexibility to continue
      serving meals to children while maintaining appropriate safety measures and
      managing the impacts of Covid-19.  Allowing SFAs to participate under SSO during
      Covid-19 operations during the regular school year facilitates the safe provision
      of meals.

      component that examines integrity features of online applications. From this
      sub-study, FNS aims to gain clarity on quality of data collected in online applications
      used by students and families who apply for free and reduced-price meals.


      Child Nutrition (CN) Integrity Rule

      FNS expects the rule’s provisions to strengthen the administration of CN programs,
      at all levels, through enhanced oversight and enforcement tools designed to
      help FNS and state administering agencies to reduce program error of all types,
      resulting in more efficient operations and improved compliance with program
      requirements. Of particular importance to the NSLP and SBP, the rule allows
      states to adopt a 5-year administrative review cycle for School Food Authorities
      (SFAs); previously States reviewed SFAs a minimum of once every three years.
      States that adopt a review cycle longer than three years must establish and
      apply risk-based criteria to select SFAs for targeted follow-up reviews. This
      change allows States to direct limited resources where attention is needed most.


      The rule also formalizes a framework for developing, testing, and introducing
      integrity-focused process improvements to address improper payment challenges
      that cannot be remedied through monitoring alone.


      Direct Certification with Medicaid (DC-M)

      Direct certification is the process by which eligible children are certified
      for free meals without the need for a household application based on household
      participation in one or more means-tested Federal assistance programs. Direct
      certification is intended to reduce both household and administrative certification
      error in Local Education Agency (LEA) processing of household applications.



      Automation - Non-competitive Technology Innovation Grants (nTIGs)

      FNS expects that the overall improvement of information technology systems by
      nTIG recipients administering NSLP will improve the State''s ability to train,
      monitor, provide technical assistance, and corrective actions.


      Encourage state agency adoption of FNS-developed data validation service

      FNS modified its process of reviewing state agency management of the NSLP to
      encourage adoption of an FNS-developed tool to reduce error in the reporting
      of NSLP administrative data. The tool, the Data Validation Service (DVS) is
      an Application Programming Interface (API) that States can include in their
      platforms for collecting data from their school districts. The DVS provides
      real-time edit checks and error messages to school districts as they submit
      data to their States.'
