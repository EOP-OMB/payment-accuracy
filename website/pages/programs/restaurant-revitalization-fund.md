  2024:
    pro1: "The RRF program was designed to provide emergency financial assistance\
      \ to eligible restaurants, bars, and other qualifying businesses as a result\
      \ of the COVID-19 pandemic. In total the program provided 100,745 grants to\
      \ eligible program participants, of which 99.83% of those grants were approved\
      \ and processed between the period May 10, 2021, to June 30, 2021. The remaining\
      \ disbursements were processed between the period April 1, 2022, through March\
      \ 31, 2023. The SBA leverages separate sampling and estimation methodologies\
      \ for each of the distinct RRF disbursement periods and combines the results\
      \ of the two estimates to derive improper and unknown payment estimates for\
      \ the program.\n\nFor RRF grant reviews, sample cases were chosen using PPS\
      \ Sampling with replacement from all disbursements during the period May 10,\
      \ 2021, through June 30, 2021. This population was divided into five strata\
      \ based on their review tier. The SBA determined the appropriate total sample\
      \ size to be 384 awards from this population. Additionally, a census sample\
      \ was drawn for all disbursements during the period April 1, 2022, through March\
      \ 31, 2023. The combined samples included aggregate outlays of $461,969,300\
      \ and an absolute value of improper payments of $71,708 within the samples.\
      \ \n\nBecause the improper and unknown payments were calculated from FY2022\
      \ and FY2023 rates and estimates, the program’s rates listed here apply to FY2022\
      \ and FY2023, and do not apply to FY2024.  The estimated program improper payment\
      \ rate for the RRF grant population is 0.0003 percent.  The program’s Unknown\
      \ payment rate for the period was 30.32 percent. At the time of this writing,\
      \ the SBA had not completed its review of 122 awards of the 384 awards in the\
      \ sample of awards originated in FY2021. However, for 53 of the 122 Awards,\
      \ SBA had collected enough information and completed a significant portion of\
      \ the reviews to be able to identify that an improper payment is likely.  For\
      \ 31 of the 122 Awards, the error stemmed from an Award calculation error. \
      \ For 20 of the 122 Awards, the error stemmed from an eligibility issue.   SBA\
      \ does not see intent on the part of the Awardees to commit fraud for these\
      \ 51 Awards.  In conducting these Post Award Reviews, SBA has only seen an indication\
      \ of potential fraud in 4 Awards.\n\nThe RRF program ended on June 30, 2021.\
      \  FY 2024 improper payment rate estimates encompassed all disbursements for\
      \ the program.  There was no funding for this program in FY2024, no disbursements\
      \ will be made in FY2025, and therefore no improper payment rates will be extrapolated.\n"
    rnp4: Review standards are established as part of the agency's annual  appraisal
      process.  These standards hold managers accountable  for meeting applicable
      reduction targets, preventing improper payments, and promptly detecting and
      recovering overpayments.  Nevertheless, this program ended in June 2021.
