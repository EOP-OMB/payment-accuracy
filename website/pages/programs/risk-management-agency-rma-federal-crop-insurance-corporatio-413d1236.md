Actions_By_Year:
  2023:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: RMA's comprehensive analysis of our improper payment
      results consists of many different criteria to include, but not limited to,
      the type of error which caused the payment to become improper, who was responsible
      for the payment becoming improper, and at what stage of the crop insurance life
      cycle the payment became improper.  This thorough analysis allows RMA to develop
      effective corrective action plans that focus on the root causes of the improper
      payments.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app17_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: A majority of the improper payments related to the inability
      to access data/information were the result of policyholders over-reporting insurable
      acres on rainfall index plans of insurance.  RMA will issue an Informational
      Memorandum reminding external stakeholders of procedural requirements related
      to acreage reporting and reiterate the importance of applying these procedures
      accurately to prevent improper payments.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app2_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: One type of error leading to improper payments for failure
      to access data/information resulted from policies established under a unit structure
      that did not meet the qualifications.  RMA policy and procedure outlines criteria
      that must be met in order to qualify for the unit structure being requested.  When
      these qualifications are not met the result is an improper payment. To further
      assess improper payments associated with unit structure, RMA will conduct a
      program review in order to determine if Approved Insurance Providers are appropriately
      applying unit structure requirements.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app6_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: RMA conducts a comprehensive analysis of the improper
      payments.  The actions taken to help reduce future improper payments are directly
      linked to the root cause of the improper payments as described above.  Our analysis
      looks at many different criteria such as, but not limited to; the stage of the
      crop insurance life cycle the error was made, who was responsible for the error,
      what the specific error was, in addition to a breakdown by crop, state, error
      type, etc.  This analysis allows RMA to develop effective corrective action
      plans and maintain a tolerable error rate.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp17_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: A large amount of RMA's improper payments resulting
      from the inability to access data/information are situations where policyholders
      could not support certifications with acceptable production evidence/records.  As
      a result, RMA Compliance worked with the Product Management Branch to update
      the Apple Crop Policy record requirements in for vertically integrated or direct-marketing
      perennial producers.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp4_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: Improper payments resulting from a failure to access
      data/information are often the result of process and/or administrative type
      errors (i.e., keying errors, calculation errors, process errors, etc.,) To address
      these types of errors, RMA Compliance reviewed Approved Insurance Provider's
      (AIP's) quality control processes as part of the AIP Performance Review (APR)
      allowing RMA to identify potential vulnerabilities that may lead to improper
      payments.  If vulnerabilities are identified, RMA issues APR outcomes and/or
      observations in which the AIP must respond with a corrective action and a timeframe
      for completion.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp6_1
  2024:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: 'To address improper payment associated with the inability
      to access/data information, RMA will conduct a program assessment of the Spot
      Check List procedures utilized and corrective actions carried out by the Approved
      Insurance Providers (AIPs). To execute this audit, RMA’s Northern Regional Compliance
      Office (NRCO) will obtain documentation used by the AIPs to conduct their reviews
      and support their determinations. Once obtained, the documentation will be reviewed
      to verify compliance with Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) policy and
      procedure.  The anticipated impact of this corrective action is to ensure that
      all AIPs are conducting Spot Check List reviews according to procedure.  In
      auditing AIP performance, RMA hopes to reduce potential program vulnerabilities,
      improper payments, and abuse in the federal crop insurance program.


      Improper payments associated with the failure to access data/information are
      often related to errors in which external stakeholders do not follow Federal
      Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC)  policies and procedures.  To address these
      types of errors RMA’s Southern Regional Compliance Office (SRCO) will be conducting
      a Cotton Loss Adjustment Program Review.  This review will determine if AIPs
      are following approved FCIC loss adjustment procedures ensuring the accuracy
      of the indemnities being issued.'
    Mitigation_Strategy: app6_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: 'A large amount of RMA''s improper payments were the
      result of insured not meeting insurability requirements and inaccurately reporting
      acreage on Pasture Rangeland Forage policies.  As a result, RMA Compliance issued
      Information Memorandum: COM-23-003 informing Approved Insurance Providers (AIPs)
      and their agents to remind insureds that acreage must be suitable and grown
      for the intended use and that verifiable records are required to be maintained
      to support acreage reported on the acreage report.'
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp2_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: Improper payments resulting from a failure to access
      data/information resulted from policies that were established using a unit structure
      that did not meet the qualifications.  RMA policy and procedure outlines criteria
      that must be met in order to qualify for the unit structure being requested.  When
      these qualifications are not met the result can be an improper payment. To address
      these types of errors, RMA Compliance conducted a program review to evaluate
      documents and determine if insureds met the criteria for the unit structure
      requested.

      of Compliance, Product Management, and Insurance Services are held accountable
      through annual performance plans to establish internal controls that prevent
      improper payments from being made, maintain internal controls that prevent improper
      payments from being made, detect improper payments that are made, and recover
      improper payments.  The Farm Production and Conservation (FPAC) Business Center
      also provides oversight of RMA's internal controls.

    rnp3: Failure to access data/information accounted for $169.93M of Risk Management
      Agency's improper dollars.  COVID-19 required Approved Insurance Providers (AIPs)
      to modify how day to day operations were conducted.  These unforeseen modifications
      presented an opportunity for less effective quality control processes resulting
      in payments being issued improperly.  RMA's corrective action plan to address
      these types of improper payments includes meeting with AIPs assess their quality
      control processes they currently have in place.  This will be carried out as
      part of RMA's AIP Performance Reviews.  Improper payments resulting from the
      inability to access data/information address errors made at the time of certification.  Improper
      payments associated with this root cause totaled $134.72M.  To address certification
      errors RMA continually reviews current policy and procedures directly related
      to areas in which the improper payments have occurred.  Strengthening current
      policy and procedure requirements is a means of improving the effectiveness
      of the certification process.

    act17_3: null
    rnp3: RMA's comprehensive analysis of improper payment criteria relates the root
      cause (i.e., the type of error that led to the improper payment, who was responsible
      for the improper payment, and at what stage of the crop insurance life cycle
      the improper payment occurred) of the improper payment directly to the amount
      of the improper payment.  This strategic assessment allows RMA to develop corrective
      action plans that address the root causes that result in larger amounts of improper
      payments. A continuous analysis of root causes and implementation of corrective
      actions that help remediate improper payments has allowed RMA to maintain a
      tolerable error for multiple years.  Federal Crop Insurance is a multi-billion-dollar
      program. RMA’s ability to maintain a improper payment error rate below three
      percent for the past nine years indicates the effectiveness of the measures
      we’ve taken to reduce improper payments.
  2024:
    act17_1: Upon the completion of RMA’s improper payment review cycle extensive
      results data is captured and analyzed for the purpose of determining root causes.  This
      analysis affords the agency the ability to evaluate the payment processes in
      order to pinpoint any procedural gaps or inefficiencies that led to the improper
      payments.  By focusing on these areas, corrective actions developed can effectively
      mitigate the risk of improper payments recurring in the future.
    act17_2: RMA’s root cause analysis provides the agency the ability to effectively
      identify the underlying causes of the improper payments.  Corrective actions
      are tailored to specific types of improper payments identified, whether they
      stem from procedural errors, inaccurate certification, or administrative deficiencies.  Once
      the root causes have been identified, corrective plans are implemented, monitored,
      and evaluated. Results are shared with stakeholders to ensure accountability
      and foster a culture of continuous improvement helping reduce future improper
      payments.
    act17_3: Corrective actions are effectively implemented by first establishing
      clear objectives and assigning specific responsibilities to team members.  Regular
      monitoring and feedback meetings ensure that progress is tracked and any obstacles
      are promptly addressed. RMA’s Payment Integrity Specialist communicates with
      stakeholders carrying out the plans in order to assure they are prioritized
      to meet all applicable deadlines.  This strategic approach fosters a clear understanding
      among team members of where to direct efforts, enhancing overall productivity
      and accountability.
