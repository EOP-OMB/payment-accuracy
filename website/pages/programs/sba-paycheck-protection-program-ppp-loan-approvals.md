  pro1: "In accordance with program regulations, when a PPP Lender received a forgiveness\
    \ application from a borrower, the Lender reviewed the application and submitted\
    \ a forgiveness decision to SBA. If the lender determined that the borrower was\
    \ entitled to forgiveness of some or all of the amount applied for, the lender\
    \ requested payment from SBA at the time the lender issued its decision to SBA.\
    \  SBA, subject to any SBA review of the borrower's loan(s) or loan application(s),\
    \ remitted the appropriate forgiveness amount to the lender, plus any interest\
    \ accrued through the date of payment.\n\nSBA reviewed the forgiveness applications\
    \ from lenders.  SBA compared the loan amount disbursed to the amount of loan\
    \ forgiveness requested.  In general, any loan amounts not forgiven were determined\
    \ to be improper.  \n\nSBA reviewed borrower eligibility, (including whether the\
    \ borrower had been debarred; whether the borrower had defaulted on federal debt\
    \ within the last 7 years; whether the borrower had been convicted of a felony\
    \ involving fraud, bribery, or embezzlement; whether the borrower was incarcerated;\
    \ and, whether the borrower was a U.S. citizen) and reviewed documentation to\
    \ determine whether the borrower’s business was in operation.  Borrowers that\
    \ were not eligible based on these eligibility criteria were denied forgiveness.\
    \  The full amount of the loan disbursed for these forgiveness denials was determined\
    \ to be improper.  \n\nSBA also reviewed documentation to determine whether borrowers\
    \ had eligible expenses during the covered period, and, if so, in what amount.\
    \  SBA determined that borrowers with no eligible expenses during the covered\
    \ period had received the loan improperly, and the full amount of the loan was\
    \ determined to be improper.  If a borrower had eligible expenses that did not\
    \ equal the amount of the loan disbursed, only that portion of the loan forgiven\
    \ was determined to be proper. The remaining unforgiven portion was determined\
    \ to be improper. \n\nImproper payment rates for the Paycheck Protection Program\
    \ loans were reported for the first time in FY2022.  The program ended on May\
    \ 31, 2021.  No loans were awarded after the program end date.\n"
  rap5: The agency has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human capital
    and information system and other infrastructure to reduce improper payments and
    unknown payments to the tolerable rate.
  rap6: No resources have requested in the most recent budget submission of the agency
    to establish and maintain the internal controls.
  rnp3: Overpayments are the result of the borrower receiving a PPP loan in an amount
    that (1) exceeds the borrower’s eligibility, (2) that cannot supported through
    documentation, or (3) that was not used for purposes permitted by statute or guidance.  In
    its review of the loan, if SBA determines that the loan is not eligible for forgiveness
    (in whole or in part), the borrower must begin paying principal and interest.
  rtp1: Unknown
  rtp4_2: This is the first year the program is reporting improper payment data.  As
    such, there is insufficient historical data to establish a tolerable rate.
