    pro1: "USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is committed to ensuring integrity\
      \ in the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) to protect taxpayer dollars and\
      \ safeguard the meals that millions of children rely on every summer. \nIn FY19\
      \ FNS performed a risk assessment of SFSP that resulted in categorizing the\
      \ program as Phase 2, susceptible to improper payments.  During the FY19 SFSP\
      \ risk assessment, program outlays were estimated as $528 million (actual $472\
      \ million) requiring only 2% of the outlays to be improperly paid to exceed\
      \ the statutory threshold of $10 million. \nSFSP’s Sampling & Estimation Methodology\
      \ Plan (S&EMP) identified FNS’ proposal of a study to measure improper payments,\
      \ with collection activities planned for the summer of 2020. The planned study\
      \ involved collecting and reviewing records from State agencies and sponsoring\
      \ organizations, along with visits to a sample of SFSP sites, to measure certification\
      \ error, reimbursement rate error, meal counting error, and aggregation error.\
      \ \nHowever, due to the COVID public health emergency, the study collection\
      \ intended for summer of 2020 has been delayed until summer of 2023, thereby\
      \ delaying reporting of an improper payment estimation for the current reporting\
      \ cycle.    Specifically, government travel restrictions due to COVID-19 prevented\
      \ FNS staff from conducting on-site data collections.  Moreover, waivers to\
      \ program operations meant SFSP was not operating the program as it normally\
      \ does, therefore any data collected during COVID would not reflect the program\
      \ operations going forward.\nSpecific details of the planned 2023 study include\
      \ the following: \nFNS’ planned study to measure SFSP improper payments (IP),\
      \ is structured similarly to USDA’s study to measure IP in the school meal programs.\
      \  The study will require collecting and reviewing records from State agencies\
      \ and sponsoring organizations, along with on-site data collection from a sample\
      \ of the program’s 50,000 sites.  These sites are in locations such as parks,\
      \ schools, and community centers.  On-site data collection is very costly. \
      \ Therefore, to reduce costs, FNS has designed a study similar to the Census\
      \ Bureau’s American Community Survey to use sponsor-level data for establishing\
      \ improper payments in certification, reimbursement rate, and aggregation. FNS\
      \ will also collect site-level data to assess meal claiming error. This approach\
      \ will not initially produce a nationally representative study that meets PIIA\
      \ requirements, so FNS plans to combine data collected over five years to develop\
      \ its full, IP estimates.  After the fifth year, FNS will maintain a five-year\
      \ moving average error rate and dollar value of program error by replacing the\
      \ oldest year’s data with data collected in the current year."

  2023:
    pro1: 'The Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) is a USDA Food and Nutrition Service
      (FNS)-funded state administered program that provides free meals and snacks
      to children in low-income areas, or approved by application, when school is
      not in session. At the local level, SFSP is administered by state-approved sponsoring
      organizations. FNS issues program funds to state agencies, which then pass the
      funds to SFSP sponsoring organizations to run the program. Sponsoring organizations
      use that money to cover both the food and administrative costs of the program.
      FNS is currently engaged in an effort to develop an improper payment estimate
      for SFSP in accordance with a Sampling and Estimation Methodology Plan (S&EMP)
      submitted for approval to Office of Management and Budget (OMB). FNS will collect
      data over a 5-year period that began in the summer of 2023. Because FNS has
      not yet determined an improper payment rate for SFSP, the agency is reporting
      zeroes in the survey’s improper payment and outlay fields. During FY23, FNS
      undertook and planned the following activities to mitigate SFSP improper payments:
      1) State agencies must offer training to sponsors each year prior to the annual
      sponsor application period. The training covers the sponsoring organization’s
      responsibilities and the site supervisor’s responsibilities. Every sponsoring
      organization must send key staff members (including directors) to that State
      agency training in order to be eligible to participate in the program. As a
      condition of approval to participate, and as part of their program agreement
      with the State agency, sponsoring organizations commit to training their site
      monitors and site personnel. 2) FNS Regional Offices also completed three Management
      Evaluations (MEs) per region, each of which include a local level review where
      FNS staff accompany State agencies on reviews of local operators. MEs provide
      a periodic assessment of State agency operations and administration; and can
      result in a report of findings which require the state agency to correct any
      problems. This helps to ensure that State agencies are properly monitoring meal
      claims at the local level; and are working with local operators to reduce any
      improper payments.'
