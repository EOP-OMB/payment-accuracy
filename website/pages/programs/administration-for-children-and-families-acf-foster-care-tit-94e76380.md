    rnp4: null
  2022:
    pro1: "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) did not report the IV-E\
      \ Foster Care national improper payment rate for FYs 2021 and 2022 due to a\
      \ lack of new data, stemming from the postponement of reviews during the COVID-19\
      \ public health emergency.  Nevertheless, HHS continues to focus targeted corrective\
      \ action efforts on continuous quality improvement and heightened communication\
      \ and outreach to states regarding best practices to address and prevent payment\
      \ errors in preparation for when the IV-E Reviews resume.  HHS relied on previous\
      \ data and experiences to develop and update its corrective action plans.  Traditionally,\
      \ all improper payments (100 percent) in the Title IV-E Foster Care Program\
      \ are administrative or process errors due to incorrect case classification\
      \ and payment processing by state agencies (e.g., Failure to Access Data/Information).\
      \  The Title IV-E Foster Care Program designs corrective action plans to help\
      \ states address the improper payments that contribute most to Title IV-E improper\
      \ payments.  Targeted corrective actions to reduce and prevent the types of\
      \ payment errors driving previous performance include: \n\n     - HHS works\
      \ with states to emphasize and develop strategies for continuous program improvement.\
      \  HHS emphasizes viewing the quality assurance process as ongoing and developing\
      \ sound program improvements that support systemic change and sustain improvement\
      \ efforts. A continuous quality improvement effort helps maintain an awareness\
      \ of the ongoing needs rather than only in a review year, which reduces incidences\
      \ of improper payments overall.\n\n     - In response to the Family First Act,\
      \ enacted as Title VII of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, HHS issued written\
      \ guidance and conducted a series of webinars in FY 2018 and has continued to\
      \ provide guidance through written responses to many questions in FYs 2019 –\
      \ 2022. These exchanges with states helped to resolve challenging eligibility\
      \ questions. They also provided opportunities to explain various aspects of\
      \ the Title IV-E requirements, clarify documentation requirements, and assist\
      \ states’ understanding of complex policy concepts and their determination on\
      \ whether a child meets Title IV-E eligibility requirements for foster care\
      \ maintenance payments. HHS will continue using lessons learned from this process\
      \ to inform future guidance and education.  In FY 2023, HHS expects to issue\
      \ an updated title IV-E review guide, instrument and instructions and will conduct\
      \ webinars and outreach to deepen federal and state staff knowledge of the federal\
      \ requirements. \n\n     - HHS, through its interactions with states,  encouraged\
      \ effective communication between state child welfare agencies and licensing\
      \ agencies to further promote adequate documentation of licensing and safety\
      \ check compliance.  Assisting states with developing and applying techniques\
      \ to effectively engage foster care providers in a partnership to reduce or\
      \ eliminate improper payments is integral to success.  HHS will also continue\
      \ to encourage states to regularly and systematically monitor foster care providers\
      \ to document and promote compliance with the Title IV-E requirements and require\
      \ non-compliant providers to undergo corrective action.\n\n     - Through its\
      \ review of claims and audit resolution, HHS continued its efforts to have states\
      \ address financial reporting and claiming errors. \n\nHHS continues to provide\
      \ training and technical assistance to states in developing and implementing\
      \ program improvements, even when states are not required to develop a Program\
      \ Improvement Plan.  This assistance helps states expand organizational capacity\
      \ and promote more effective program operations.  Corrective actions have decreased\
      \ the overall number of payment errors and altered the composition of identified\
      \ payment errors.  For example, following years of work with State Court Improvement\
      \ Programs and outreach to heighten judicial awareness, judiciary-related errors,\
      \ once the most prevalent error type, are now among the least common. HHS will\
      \ continue to work closely with states and Tribes to ensure they have a clear\
      \ understanding of the federal requirements and are prepared to effectively\
      \ manage their foster care programs. \nHHS staff and technical assistance providers\
      \ also have offered technical assistance on Title IV-E eligibility issues to\
      \ Tribes operating or planning to operate the Title IV-E Foster Care Program,\
      \ many of whom have limited previous experience in matters relating to Title\
      \ IV-E eligibility determinations."

  2023:
    pro1: "Since its initial baseline reporting in FY 2004, HHS has continued to focus\
      \ on identifying and reducing improper payments through ongoing corrective actions,\
      \ including on-site reviews, post-on-site review activities, the Court Improvement\
      \ Program, enhanced use of automated information systems, publicizing best practices,\
      \ other continuous quality improvement efforts and targeted outreach. In response\
      \ to the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, HHS postponed conducting Title IV-E\
      \ Reviews beginning in April 2020, thus affecting improper payment reporting\
      \ for the Title IV-E Foster Care program because the Title IV-E Reviews provide\

      \ IV-E Reviews, HHS conducted two training webinars in March 2023 for HHS staff,\
      \ covering the updated Review Instrument and its instructions, and in April\
      \ 2023 conducted two training webinars for Title IV-E agencies, offering guidance\

    rnp4: HHS evaluates its processes and controls each year in accordance with the
      requirements of the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-123, Management’s
      Responsibility for Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Controls, which includes
      Appendix C, Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement. As part of this
      annual assessment, HHS requires its offices to complete an Internal Control
      and Risk Management Certification that is signed by a senior member of the applicable
      office. Further, the HHS Operating Division prepares an assurance statement
      which represents the HHS Operating Division head's informed judgement as to
      the overall adequacy and effectiveness of Internal controls within the HHS Operating
      Division related to operations, reporting, and compliance. In addition, non-federal
      entities that receive federal funds, including states, local governments, tribes,
      and non-profit organizations, are subject to audit requirements under the Single
      Audit Act of 1984, as amended in 1996. The implementing guidance, Uniform Administrative
      Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, that
      was in effect during FY 2023, required Single Audits for nonfederal entities
      that expend $750,000 or more in federal awards during the nonfederal entity’s
      fiscal year. With the Office of Management and Budget's April 2024 released
      revisions to the Uniform Guidance, the threshold increases to $1,000,000 effective
      October 01, 2024.  In addition to the improper payment error rate calculation
      activities, overpayments are identified and recovered through Single Audits
      and HHS Office of Inspector General audits.  For each of the aforementioned
      activities, recipients are subject to disallowances for any expenditures not
      made in accordance with program regulations.

  2024:
    act17_1: The actions taken by HHS were focused on the cause of the Improper Payments
      and Unknown Payments in the Title IV-E Foster Care Program because the assistance
      was targeted to address the root causes of errors because HHS identified specific
      root causes of errors and associated corrective actions for each reviewed state.
      In FY 2024, HHS resumed conducting onsite Title IV-E Foster Care Eligibility
      Reviews, following a nearly four-year suspension due to the response to the
      COVID-19 pandemic.  Although HHS did not conduct any new reviews during the
      period of suspension, HHS relied on previous data and experiences to develop
      and update its corrective action plans, which are designed to help states address
      the improper payments that contribute most to Title IV-E improper payments.  The
      adequacy of these actions is reflected in the low FY 2024 reported error rate
      of 4.82%.
    act17_2: The corrective actions taken by HHS are adequate for the Title IV-E Foster
      Care Program because the assistance is targeted to address the specific root
      causes of errors for each reviewed state. In FY 2024, HHS resumed conducting
      onsite Title IV-E Foster Care Eligibility Reviews, following a nearly four-year
      suspension due to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The adequacy of these
      corrective actions is reflected in the low FY 2024 reported error rate of 4.82%.
    act17_3: The effective implementation and prioritization of the corrective actions
      taken for the Title IV-E Foster Care Program are evidenced in HHS's continued
      development and delivery of corrective actions to reduce the occurrence of Improper
      and Unknown Payments despite the nearly four-year suspension of calculating
      and reporting an error rate due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although HHS did not
      conduct any new reviews during the period of suspension, HHS relied on previous
      data and experiences to develop and update its corrective action plans to help
      states address the root causes that contributed most to Title IV-E improper
      payments.  Since HHS did not calculate and report an Improper Payment and Unknown
      Payment rate from FY 2020 through FY 2023, we cannot determine if the actions
      are effective in reducing the rate, however, the FY 2024 reported error rate
      of 4.82% is significantly less than the statutory threshold of 10%.
    rnp3: HHS anticipates that the level of planned or completed corrective actions
      will address the cause of the Improper Payments and potential Unknown Payments
      proportional to the severity of the associated amount and rate of the root cause.  During
      the Title IV-E Foster Care Eligibility Reviews, HHS identified specific root
      causes of errors and associated corrective actions for each reviewed state.  In
      FY 2024, HHS resumed conducting onsite Title IV-E reviews, following a nearly
      four-year suspension due to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  During the
      period of the suspension, HHS relied on previous data and experiences to develop
      and update its corrective action plans, which are designed to help states address
      the improper payments that contribute most to Title IV-E improper payments.  The
      adequacy of these actions is reflected in the low FY 2024 reported error rate
      of 4.82%.

    rap5: HHS has not determined if it has what is needed with respect to internal
      controls, human capital and information system and other infrastructure to reduce
      improper payments and unknown payments to the tolerable rate because HHS has
      not determined a tolerable rate for the Foster Care program.   In FY 2024, HHS
      resumed conducting onsite Title IV-E Foster Care Eligibility Reviews, following
      a nearly four-year suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   The IV-E Review
      protocol is not conducted specifically for improper payment estimation but is
      instead governed by regulations authorizing federal monitoring of child welfare
      programs.  Data from the Title IV-E Foster Care Eligibility Reviews are used
      to calculate the Foster Care Error Rate.
    rap6: The HHS FY 2025 Justification of Estimates for Appropriations Committees
      includes a request for $10.68 billion for the Payments for Foster Care, Prevention,
      and Permanency appropriation, which provides funding for the Title IV-E Foster
      Care  and other related programs.  This appropriation also supports administrative
      and training costs. This account is subject to sequestration of administrative
      costs in an otherwise exempt account in accordance with the Balanced Budget
      and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-177), as amended by the Budget
      Control Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-25), which affects funding for certain activities
      under Foster Care, and other related programs.  Other than administrative and
      training costs, no request were made for resources specifically for establishing
      and maintaining payment integrity.
    rtp4_2: HHS has not determined the tolerable rate for this program because in
      FY 2024, HHS resumed conducting onsite Title IV-E Foster Care Eligibility Reviews,
      following a nearly four-year suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   The
      IV-E Review protocol is not conducted specifically for improper payment estimation
      but is instead governed by regulations authorizing federal monitoring of child
      welfare programs.  Data from the Title IV-E Foster Care Eligibility Reviews
      are used to calculate the Foster Care Error Rate.
