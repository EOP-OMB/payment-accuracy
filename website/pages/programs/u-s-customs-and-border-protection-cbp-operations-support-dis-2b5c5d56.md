    pro1: 'During the Hurricane Harvey, Irma, and Maria disasters, CBP’s highest priorities
      were to promote lifesaving and life-sustaining activities, the safe evacuation
      of people who are leaving the impacted area, the maintenance of public order,
      the prevention of the loss of property to the extent possible, and the speedy
      recovery of the region. At the request of FEMA, local and state authorities,
      DHS law enforcement personnel would be in the affected areas to conduct search
      and rescue, air traffic de-confliction and public safety missions. CBP was also
      responsible for providing for the safety and security of CBP employees and associated
      family members. As such, CBP actively evacuated employees as needed, from the
      paths of the hurricanes.


      For the testing conducted in 2021, CBP’s assessment was focused on the associated
      FY 2019 disaster supplemental funding disbursements of over $17 million applicable
      for review under PIIA. For additional information on the results of this assessment,
      please refer to the FY 2021 published data on paymentaccuracy.gov.


      Although FY 2020 disbursement totals related to the Supplemental Appropriations
      remained above $10M, based on Phase 2 statistical testing performed, results
      published in FY 2020 (over FY 2018 disbursements) and FY 2021 (over FY 2019
      disbursements) indicated that the program was not susceptible to significant
      improper payments. In accordance with OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C guidance,
      DHS has determined that the program has been baselined and has converted the
      program back to Phase 1 for FY 2022 reporting based on the quantitative results
      of the testing. In addition, FY 2021 disbursement totals for the U.S. Customs
      and Border Protection (CBP) – Operations & Support - Disaster Supplemental Funds
      program dropped below $10M, thus the program is no longer eligible for PIIA
      reporting in the current year.'

    rnp3: 'Since the IPs and UPs within the Agency are below the DHS and CBP threshold
      the purpose of the completed and planned remediation actions is to further reduce
      the amount of IPs and UPs. CBP primarily prioritizes reducing IPs due to supplemental
      appropriation misuse and transaction that are technically improper due to statutory
      or contractual breaks. '

    rap5: Program is reflective of disaster supplemental funding that was received
      by DHS to respond to the Hurricane Harvey, Irma, and Maria disasters that occurred
      in the 2017 / 2018 timeframe. Due to the burden of testing and reporting, Disaster
      Supplemental Funding programs are tested and reported two years in arrears.
      As such, by the time that remedial action is taken and/or is realized in the
      PIIA testing results, the total value of annual disbursements is expected to
      be below the threshold for PIIA action. DHS will continue to make process and
      internal control improvements to improve the payment management processes as
      it relates to supplemental funding but feels that internal control, human capital,
      information system, and infrastructure needs have been met.
