  2023:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Response not applicable because the ESF program's IP
      and UP estimate is below the statutory threshold.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app17_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: These were accounting errors that resulted in rounding
      errors made by the recipients of the funds. The small amounts identified relative
      to the program outlays would not usually present an opportunity to efficiently
      use resources to attempt to recover.

  2023:
    pro1: "Unknown Payments (UPs) were the primary driver of this program’s high estimated\
      \ Improper Payment (IP) and Unknown Payment (UP) rate reported in FY22. The\
      \ UPs identified in FY22 were the result of lack of documentation due to the\
      \ delayed start of the study and the payment recipients not understanding what\
      \ type of supporting documentation to provide to satisfy the requirements of\
      \ the study. The Department implemented effective mitigation strategies in FY23\
      \ which resulted in the elimination of UPs, and subsequently the significant\
      \ reduction of the estimated IP and UP rate in FY23. The strategies implemented\
      \ are as follows:\n\n1. The Department began the FY23 study earlier in the fiscal\
      \ year, providing sufficient time for State Education Agencies (SEAs) to obtain\
      \ and provide supporting documentation from Local Education Agencies (LEAs)\
      \ for the program’s payments.\n\n2. The Department also provided SEAs with targeted\
      \ technical assistance and training. This assistance encompassed technical assistance\
      \ meetings with certain states, written guidance, and payment documentation\
      \ criteria guidance. \n\nAdditionally, The Department formally issued its policy\
      \ on Payment Integrity, providing guidance to agency employees, in Fiscal Year\
      \ 2023."

    rnp4: 'Department personnel, including executive managers and staff, are held
      accountable for promoting payment

      integrity and maintaining effective internal controls in their day-to-day jobs.
      Key management officials have

      specific expectations related to payment integrity included in their annual
      performance plans. Program officials who administer programs deemed susceptible
      to significant improper payments are highly engaged in developing and implementing
      corrective actions as well as providing technical assistance for grantees to
      prevent improper payments for being made and to ensure payments are supported
      by sufficient documentation. Due to the improper payment and unknown payment
      estimate being below the statutory threshold, a reduction target is not required
      for this program.

      in FY 2022. While the baseline for the program has not been established and
      the tolerable rate has not been identified, the program has taken steps to address
      the unknown payments identified at the conclusion of the study. For each unknown
      payment sample in the study, the responsible program office will provide a written
      determination whether the payment was proper or improper. The program offices
      will communicate to their subprogram grantees regarding obtaining and/or providing
      supporting documentation to the Department, as part of its efforts to comply
      with PIIA. Messaging to grantees will include establishing expectations by providing
      grantees with background on PIIA, the anticipated timeline, the importance of
      being attentive and responsive to the payment integrity team’s communications
      and requests, and the type of documentation requested under the Fiscal Year
      2023 methodology to substantiate sampled payments.
