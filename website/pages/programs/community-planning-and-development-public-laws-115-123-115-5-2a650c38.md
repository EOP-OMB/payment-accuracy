    pro1: Payment integrity, ensuring the right funds reach the right recipient at
      the right point in time, is critical for HUD’s mission in meeting US housing
      requirements.  OCFO redesigned processes with CPD by streamlining record retrieval,
      extending testing periods, and increasing OCFO support to the program office
      by over 1,000 hours.  In partnership with CPD, achieved under 1% payment error
      rate, which demonstrated reliability and integrity for approximately $1.5 billion
      in payments from HUD through to the sub-recipient levels. As a result, the program
      graduated from the high-risk/susceptible to improper payments category for the
      CPD PL Disaster grants.
