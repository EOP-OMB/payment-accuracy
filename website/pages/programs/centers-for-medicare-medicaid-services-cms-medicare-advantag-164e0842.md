      collaborated on case leads and promising practices. HHS also maintained formal
      outreach to plan sponsors for incomplete or invalid documentation to address
      potential improper payments during the sample submission period.  Furthermore,
      HHS sent Final Findings Reports to all Part C sponsors participating in the
      improper payment measurement, offering feedback on their submissions and validation

    pro1: CMS implemented policy and methodology refinements to improve the accuracy
      of the payment error estimate and reflect improper payment measurement policy.
      These refinements contributed to a decrease in the projected Part C improper
      payment rate, representing a new baseline improper payment rate for Part C,
      therefore the 2022 Part C improper payment rate is not directly comparable with
      prior reporting years.
