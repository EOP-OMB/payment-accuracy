  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: The Military Pay - Army program's corrective action
      plan describes the Army National Guard identifying each Soldier’s State and
      United States Financial Pay Office (USFPO) to include their audit teams in order
      to obtain the required key supporting documents.  Additionally, if the Soldier
      was mobilized prior to time of payment, the mobilization platform supporting
      finance office will be contacted to request for the key supporting document.  Guidance
      will be provided to the States, USFPO, and Internal Review Offices to ensure
      key supporting documents are properly archived in the Soldier’s iPERMS account.

  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: The Army National Guard primary role within the Military
      Pay - Army program's corrective action plan is to identify each Soldier’s State
      and United States Financial Pay Office (USFPO) to include their audit teams
      to obtain the required key supporting documents. By identifying State, USFPO,
      and Internal Review Offices that has military pay/human resources purview of
      the Soldier pinpoints where the responsibility of maintaining Soldiers pay record
      and entering applicable key support documents in designated repositories.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app17_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: 'The Department of Army has established a working group
      to update all Army  key supporting documentation (KSD) outlined in the required
      document list (RDL) within Appendix B of Army Regulation (AR) 600-8-104 in order
      to have KSD present within  Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management
      System (IPERMS) for each entitlement received.  The Integrated Personnel and
      Pay System - Army (IPPS-A) supports audit readiness by automatically producing
      and/or sending certain required documents and KSD to IPERMS via system interface.


      Whereas Human Resource (HR) professionals have traditionally produced orders
      manually and managed payment-related actions on a DA Form 4187, IPPS-A has modernized
      Army HR processes and developed a system for managing talent, reduce IT and
      military pay costs, and improve Soldiers'' lives through automation capabilities,
      reducing the potential for human error.


      Army Regulation 600-8-104, Army Military Human Resource Records Management,
      requires entitlement KSD to be present within a Service member’s IPERMS record
      to substantiate entitlements disbursed to the member.'
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp17_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: The FY 2023 Corrective Action Plan for the Military
      Pay – Army Program was developed to address unknown payments due to the lack
      of or inability to provide adequate key supporting documentation for disbursements
      from samples selected during post pay review of the program.  The error reason
      for the majority of the unknown payments was that entitlements were not uploaded
      to the Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management System (IPERMS),
      preventing the post-pay reviewer from determining whether the impacted payments
      were proper or improper.

      The actions implemented to obtain the applicable key supporting document included
      a Detailed review of the Soldier’s pay system, Finance repository (CEDMS) and
      the Army Personnel repository (iPERMS). Additionally, the Army coordinated with
      various Department Components such as DFAS, HRC, Office of the Surgeon General,
      Army Units/S-1s. These efforts improved our collection of applicable key supporting
      documents and we will continue to do so. The FY 2022 CAP includes coordination
      to establish a working group with Army G-1 agencies to improve efforts for Soldiers
      to validate their personnel record in iPERMS. This working group purpose is
      to identify the reasoning of Soldiers missing key supporting documents (KSDs)
      in their iPERMS and provide course of actions to improve the deficiency in accordance
      with Army Regulation 600-8-104.


      During the FY 2022 Military Pay Review, the majority error reason was the entitlement
      document was not provided. The Army personnel repository for Soldier''s records
      is IPERMS, where often times the KSD was not uploaded. Additionally, the coordination
      between DFAS ESS, DFAS FIN OPS, Army Reserve, National Guard, and Army HRC has
      improved tremendously, which has consistently decreased the Army Military Pay
      Improper Pay estimates and rates.'

    rap6: The Department's Military Pay - Army program did not have any specific recent
      budget submission to assist in bringing the program into compliance that the
      Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) Payment Integrity Team
      is aware.
    rtp4_2: The Department cannot establish an effective tolerable rate until the
      Department can produce reliable Payment Integrity estimates for the programs
      that are currently in Phase II. The DoD Office of Inspector General (OIG) concluded
      that the previous Department estimates were unreliable and caused primarily
      by using an inappropriate variable, which led to insufficient sample sizes and
      incomplete universe of transactions (UoT) to pull the Payment Integrity sample
      population for testing. The Department has since implemented several DoD OIG
      recommendations by performing UoT reconciliations for the Payment Integrity
      Programs to solidify the Sampling and Estimation Plans and creating a Payment
      Integrity Risk Appetite Statement to verify the effectiveness of the population
      to create the samples from. Additionally, the Department Payment Integrity teams
      have collaborated and have a specific formula that has been approved by the
      DoD OIG to produce more reliable estimates and sufficient sample sizes by testing
      higher and lower risk payment types accordingly. This new formula and process
      is anticipated to produce more reliable estimates and streamline the Department’s
      efforts to achieve Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) Compliance during
      the FY 2023 Payment Integrity compliance audit. Once the Department has DoD
      OIG confirmed reliable estimates, the Department will be able to establish effective
      and cost beneficial tolerable rates for the Payment Integrity programs.

    cyp15: 'Yes'
    cyp20_2: The Department is fully confident in the Army corrective action plan
      (CAP). This CAP will be efficiently implemented and will be fully effective
      at considerably reducing the improper and unknown payment rates below the OMB
      statutory threshold in fiscal year (FY) 2024. This is an aggressive and yet
      fully anticipated reduction targets that the Department can achieve in FY 2024.
      Specifically, the projected Improper Payments is anticipated to be reduced by
      25% and the Unknown Payments reduced by 75% once the National Guard implements
      the corrective actions.
    rap5: 'Internal Controls:

      The Army has internal controls in place that support the reduction of improper
      payments in its Military Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted.
      Moreover, Military Pay Services, which support the end-to-end delivery of payroll

      Pay program evolves and DoD operations change, additional skill sets, and personnel
      resources may be needed to sustain and advance the program.

      However, implementing the new strategy for achieving compliance will necessitate

      to improve the accuracy and efficiency of Military Pay through implementation
      of new integrated pay and personnel processing systems. The Army continues to
      make progress towards fully implementing the Integrated Pay and Personnel System
      – Army (IPPS-A) in the future. Under IPPS-A, improper payments will be reduced
      because entitlements will be directly inputted into the Military Pay payroll
      system by an authorized personnel source thereby eliminating all manual processing.
      Moreover, the Automated Disbursing System, the Centralized Disbursing System,

    cyp8: The Army Military Pay scenarios are broad and complex based upon the requirements
      to authorize an entitlement or deduction. For example, an unknown sample covering
      military pay and allowances, which could be for multiple reasons. After researching
      the unknown sample, the Soldier acquired a debt for being over-agent-in transit.
      Because of this, the debt was caused systematically generated, due to the late
      processing of the arrival finance transaction of the Soldier. The key supporting

    cyp7_ucp4_1: The Military Pay- Army program scenarios are broad and complex based
      upon the requirements to authorize an entitlement or deduction. The Army Commanders
      and unit Human Resource professionals sometimes do not strictly adhere to the
      current Army regulations and policies regarding document retention or processing
      and uploading the finalized document to the Army repository. The key supporting
      documentation (KSD) must be stored in the proper repository (i.e. IPERMS) readily
      available for audit. The stakeholder’s inability to retain the paid entitlements
      KSDs in IPERMS causes the Military Pay- Army program's Improper Pay rate estimates
      to increase in fiscal year 2023.
    cyp8: The Military Pay- Army program scenarios are broad and complex based upon
      the requirements to authorize an entitlement or deduction. For example, an unknown
      sample covering military pay and allowances, which could be for multiple reasons.
      Military Pay - Army payments are identified as unknown due to appropriate/applicable
      key supporting documents (KSDs) not readily available to be reviewed.  The KSDs
      were not in the designated repositories. The Army will continue to research
      the appropriate repositories to obtain the applicable KSDs to resolve these
      errors. The primary repositories are iPERMS and CEDMS.
