    pro1: 'As part of the Disaster Supplemental Funding received by DHS, funding was
      provided to the OIG for conducts audits, inspections, and investigations related
      to the FEMA disaster assistance programs under the Stafford Act, FEMA disaster
      related programs, and other DHS programs that were provided Disaster Supplemental
      Funding. For the testing conducted in 2021, OIG’s assessment was focused on
      the associated FY 2019 disaster supplemental funding disbursements of over $16
      million applicable for review under PIIA. For additional information on the
      results of this assessment, please refer to the FY 2021 published data on paymentaccuracy.gov.


      FY 2020 and FY 2021 disbursement totals for the Office of Inspector General
      (OIG) - Audits, Inspections, & Investigations – Disaster Supplemental Funds
      program dropped below $10M, thus the program is no longer eligible for PIIA
      reporting in the current year.'

    rnp3: 'OIG continues its efforts in finding out the causes of IPs/UPs through
      a semi-annual internal control process.  The results of these internal control
      reviews are shared with respective program offices to enhance their internal
      processes and assist in mitigating the risk of improper payments. OIG also supports
      training efforts to ensure that personnel are sufficiently educated on improper
      payments and financial control issues. OIG will sustain its internal control
      and training efforts outlined above.  These actions will continue to be refined
      and enhanced on an ongoing basis. '

    rap5: Program is reflective of disaster supplemental funding that was received
      by DHS to respond to the Hurricane Harvey, Irma, and Maria disasters that occurred
      in the 2017 / 2018 timeframe. Due to the burden of testing and reporting, Disaster
      Supplemental Funding programs are tested and reported two years in arrears.
      As such, by the time that remedial action is taken and/or is realized in the
      PIIA testing results, the total value of annual disbursements is expected to
      be below the threshold for PIIA action. DHS will continue to make process and
      internal control improvements to improve the payment management processes as
      it relates to supplemental funding but feels that internal control, human capital,
      information system, and infrastructure needs have been met.
