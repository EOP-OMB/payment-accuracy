Actions_By_Year:
  2023:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: SBA is currently in the process of developing a new
      unified lending platform, which is heavily based on automation of the loan making
      process.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app1_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Planned actions are focused on continuing to audit on
      an ongoing basis to provide current feedback to the Processing and Disbursement
      Center (PDC). This feedback allows the PDC to tailor trainings to address audit
      findings which are directly associated with IPs/UPs. In addition, automation
      through the unified lending platform will implement third party verifications
      and business rules directly tied to eligible recipient and eligible amount.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app17_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Per Numbered Memo 22-04, training specific to Improper
      Payment Audit findings is required on an ongoing basis.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app3_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: "Per Numbered Memo 22-04, the Disaster Internal Controls\
      \ Division is required to perform quality control and quality assurance audits\

  2024:
    pro1: 'Disaster Assistance Loans provide low-interest loans to help businesses
      and homeowners recover from declared disasters. Disaster assistance is available
      to all businesses located within a declared disaster area, private non-profit
      organizations, homeowners, and renters affected by declared disasters. Disaster
      assistance loans can be used to pay for personal or business losses not covered
      by insurance or funding from other government agencies, as well as for business
      operating expenses that could have been met had the disaster not occurred.  The
      Disaster Assistance Loan Program is a direct loan program, meaning that SBA
      approves and makes the loans and there are no intermediary lenders.


      The Disaster Assistance Loan program reviews for Improper Payments were conducted
      to determine whether loans were materially in compliance with SBA guidance,
      including to determine whether borrowers were eligible for the Disaster Assistance
      loan, whether the amount approved was correct, whether the loan was made in
      accordance with existing regulations, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and
      other internal guidance.

      Disaster Assistance Loan samples are selected from loan disbursements.  A disaster
      assistance loan may have several disbursements before it is disbursed in full.   During
      the loan review process, SBA reviews the original loan processing and underwriting,
      any loan modifications, such as increases in the loan amount or additional borrowers,
      to determine eligibility of the borrower and whether the amount is appropriate.  SBA
      also verifies that the amount of loan is commensurate with the amount of damage.  Finally,
      SBA reviews the actual disbursement to determine that the monies are provided
      to the right person, in the right amount, and for an eligible use of proceeds.'
    rnp4: Review standards are established as part of the agency's annual  appraisal
      process.  These standards hold managers accountable  for meeting applicable
      reduction targets, preventing improper payments, and promptly detecting and
      recovering overpayments.

    rnp3: The planned automation through the new unified lending platform will implement
      business rules directly related to eligible recipient and eligible amount. In
      addition, it will utilize third party verification to confirm eligibility. The
      ongoing training and corrective actions required by Numbered Memo 22-04 address
      current areas of concerns, allowing the PDC trainings to focus on identified
      areas. The certification required by Numbered Memo 22-04 the PDC and Center
      Director establish accountability for trainings and corrective actions.
  2024:
    act17_1: In addition to quarterly training for staff, the SBA revised its corrective
      action processes in FY2022. Corrective actions, which typically include obtaining
      supporting documentation from the borrower, are completed within 15 days of
      being informed of the improper payment.

    act17_3: Continuous training, along with other corrective actions, has helped
      to stabilize improper payments in the Disaster Assistance Program.
    rnp3: 'The prevalent causes of improper payments stemmed from improper accounting
      of verified losses on disaster-damaged property, duplication of benefits not
      adequately addressed, misallocation of loan funds, improper calculation or determination
      of economic injury eligibility, and closing fees deducted from loans contrary
      to the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).


      SBA provides quarterly training to loan approval staff on the causes of and
      prevention of improper payments.

    cyp15: 'Yes'
    cyp20_2: The FY 2022 improper payment rate estimate of 3.06 percent for this program
      is less than the target reduction rate of 3.71 percent from FY 2021.  Because
      of the reduction in the improper payment rate, the Disaster Assistance Loan
      program is considered to have met its reduction target. For FY 2023, the SBA
      established a reduction target of 2.96 percent for the Disaster Assistance Loan
      program.
    rap5: The agency has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human capital
      and information system and other infrastructure to reduce improper payments
      and unknown payments to the tolerable rate.
    rap6: No resources were requested in the most recent budget submission of the
      agency to establish and maintain the internal controls.
    rtp4_2: In FY 2022, the SBA refined the improper payment review procedures to
      ensure only payments that are truly improper are identified as improper. As
      such, the SBA does not have sufficient historical data to determine an acceptable
      tolerable rate for this program.

    cyp15: 'Yes'
    cyp20_2: The reduction target represents a .10% decrease from the prior year's
      improper payment rate, which is anticipated due to automation, training, and
      corrective actions plan. The training and corrective actions are required by
      Numbered Memo 22-04.

      capital and information system

      and other infrastructure to reduce Improper Payments and Unknown Payments.'
    rap6: 'No additional resources for this program were requested.

      '

      near future.

      the lesser of the established tolerable rate, or the current reported improper
      payment rate (i.e., if the FY 2024 improper payment rate is less than the established
      tolerable rate, the FY 2024 improper payment rate will be the reduction target).
    rap5: The agency has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human capital
      and information system and other infrastructure to reduce improper payments
      and unknown payments to the tolerable rate.
