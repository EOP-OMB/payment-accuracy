    pro1: The Department's Military Pay - Air Force Payment Integrity program has
      demonstrated continuous improvement over the years in reducing Improper and
      Unknown payments. As the requirements for the Military Pay - Air Force Payment
      Integrity program has increased to align with the PIIA and OMB requirements
      for distinct goal of achieving full compliance, the Air Force have developed
      tools to help with management of the programs across the Total Force, ensuring
      accountability and overall quality sample package submissions for review. One
      of those key Air Force management led improvements was allocating a specific
      Payment Integrity team to ensure the priority of Payment Integrity lines of
      efforts are established and executed appropriately.

    rap6: The Air Force Military Pay Payment Integrity program did not have any specific
      recent budget submission to assist in bringing the program into PIIA compliance.
    rtp4_2: The Department cannot establish an effective tolerable rate until the
      Department can produce reliable Payment Integrity estimates for the programs
      that are currently in Phase II. The DoD Office of Inspector General (OIG) concluded
      that the previous Department estimates were unreliable and caused primarily
      by using an inappropriate variable which led to insufficient sample sizes, and
      incomplete universe of transactions (UoT) to pull the Payment Integrity sample
      population for testing. The Department has since implemented several DoD OIG
      recommendations by performing UoT reconciliations for the Payment Integrity
      Programs to solidify the Sampling and Estimation Plans, created a Payment Integrity
      Risk Appetite Statement to verify the effectiveness of the population to create
      the samples from. Additionally, the Department Payment Integrity teams have
      collaborated and have a specific formula that has been approved by the DoD OIG
      to produce more reliable estimates and sufficient sample sizes by testing higher
      and lower risk payment types accordingly. This new formula and process is anticipated
      to produce estimates that are more reliable and streamline the Department’s
      efforts to achieve Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) Compliance during
      the FY 2023 Payment Integrity compliance audit. Once the Department has DoD
      OIG confirmed reliable estimates; the Department will be able to establish effective
      and cost beneficial tolerable rates for the Payment Integrity programs.

    cyp8: The Air Force Military Pay unknown payments for FY 2022 are still being
      researched due to timing constraints with the Department's payment integrity
      compliance audit execution timeline.  The Air Force's key supporting documentation
      was not readily available; however, they are still researching applicable systems
      to potentially produce alternate documents that would provide reasonable assurance
      the payments were proper.  Documents may need to be recreated based on member’s
      records and would then be changed to a Technically Improper classification and
      would not require recovery.

    cyp7_ucp4_1: For Demolition Pay, a DD114 is required with Commander’s signature
      and an annual recertification is required.  The Commander must recertify that
      the member is performing the functions to maintain the Demolition Pay.  These
      annual recertifications have not been properly completed.  Other files for Basic
      Allowance for Housing (BAH) and Family Separation Allowance were not properly
      maintained for the reporting period.  Further research is required to determine
      if periods of temporary duty and dependency status to qualify members for family
      separation allowance can be identified.  For BAH, further research is being
      conducted on personnel records to determine dependency status and to have members
      recertify their entitlement.
    cyp8: The Department of the Air Force (DAF), which includes Air Force and Space
      Force, had a total of 9 samples out of 2,412 samples that contained Unknown
      Payments, specifically certain entitlements that could not be properly substantiated
      to validate the disbursement. Three specific entitlements were related to Demolition
      incentive pay that lacked timely recertifications. Current efforts are being
      worked to obtain recertifications from the Commander. The remaining Unknown
      Payments were attributed to the failure to properly maintain the proper documentation
      or adhere to DAF policies for document retention.
