    pro1: The Department’s Defense Health Agency (DHA) is responsible for the delivery
      of health care services for TRICARE beneficiaries.  DHA remains committed to
      reducing improper payments through improved communication and collaborative
      efforts with stakeholders and providers and through improved performance of
      the established health care contracts. DHA continues to explore opportunities
      to improve the identification of errors, determine specific OMB root causes,
      and work with other Departments and Federal Agencies to resolve situations that
      may contribute to improper payments.  Additionally, DHA aggressively pursued
      corrective actions that resulted in consistent reduction in improper payments
      in fiscal year 2022.

      \ unknown payments decreased by $170.90 million, from $338.88 million in FY\
      \ 2020 to $167.98 million in FY 2021.  The primary root cause of improper payments\
      \ in this program was attributed to Failure to Access Data/Information category,\

    rnp3: The Department’s Defense Health Agency (DHA) is developing a risk-based
      sampling methodology to directly address the root causes of frequent and high
      dollar errors.  With this added focus on claim characteristics, DHA program
      offices, payment integrity team, Contracting Officers, and their Representatives
      will be able to devote resources where they are most needed to reduce and eliminate
      Improper Payments and Unknown Payments in the future.  Focus studies to test
      the risk-based sampling methodology will begin early in FY2023. Additionally,
      as part of the corrective action for relevant contracts, DHA will specifically
      address and reduce the frequency of these types of error assessments such as
      High Frequency Error Type, Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Per-Diem Rate Miscalculated,
      Reimbursement Method Miscalculated, and Documentation to Support Payments made
      by Other Health Insurance.

    rap5: "\"Internal Controls:\nDHA has internal controls in place to support the\
      \ reduction of improper payments in the TRICARE purchased health care program\
      \ to the levels the DHA has targeted.  Effective January 1, 2018, and in fulfillment\
      \ of section 701 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2017, the\
      \ DHA implemented sweeping changes to the TRICARE health benefits structure\
      \ and MCS contract management to synchronize these changes.  As a result, the\
      \ DHA transitioned its TRICARE-3 MCSCs (supported by three regional contracts/contractors)\
      \ to the TRICARE 2017 contract and regional oversight model (supported by two\
      \ regional contracts/contractors).  \nWhile the transition of MCSC contracts\
      \ from three to two was considered a success, the transitioning of claims processing\
      \ services under one of the two T2017 MCSC was met with challenges and control\
      \ failures.  As a result of a contractor’s poor claims processing performance,\
      \ DHA’s program and contracting offices increased oversight and monitoring of\
      \ the T2017 contractor.  Significant progress was made in FY 2020 and FY 2021\
      \ by the DHA and the MCSC contractor to resolve this deficiency and DHA met\
      \ its goal of full resolution by the FY 2021 AFR reporting cycle.  Moreover,\
      \ the Contract Resource Management division of DHA received an unmodified audit\
      \ opinion on its financial statements in FY 2020.\n\nHuman Capital:\nCurrently,\
      \ DHA does not have the Human Capital it needs to respond to audit findings\
      \ and recommendations to reduce improper payments in the Military Health Benefits\
      \ program to the level the Agency has targeted. DHA is evaluating the possibility\
      \ of adding two additional FTEs to their payment integrity efforts. \nPer a\
      \ DoDIG recommendation in 2019, Administrative and Other Payment sampling and\
      \ audits are being developed for annual improper payment reporting. These audits\
      \ for PIIA compliance, are in addition to the current Prompt Pay Audits, and\
      \ have demonstrated a need for additional Human Capital. Much work has already\
      \ been done to identify internal control weaknesses and identify and gather\
      \ additional necessary documentation; but, the resources to review payments\
      \ in their entirety are insufficient. DHA is anticipating a risk assessment\
      \ for USFHP, which accounts for nearly 40% of administrative costs, and has\
      \ identified other administrative payments that are suited for risk assessments.\
      \ For time-intensive manual CAP-DME payment reviews, a database was developed\
      \ to track prior payments to avoid duplicate requests for payment in future\
      \ invoices. This database is in its third phase of development and has showed\
      \ effectiveness in preventing duplicate payments going forward. \nIn addition,\
      \ DHA anticipates the agency will need additional skill sets and personnel resources\
      \ to make determinations on improper payments when addressing adjustments in\
      \ both the universes and in payment errors for PIIA reporting.\n\nInformation\
      \ Systems and Other Infrastructure:\nDHA has the information systems and other\
      \ infrastructure it needs to reduce improper payments in the Military Health\
      \ Benefits program to the levels the Agency has targeted.  The Agency Private\
      \ Sector program (managed by the Contract Resource Management Division) includes\
      \ an immense volume of healthcare claims processed by TRICARE private sector\
      \ contractors, into the Agency’s TRICARE Encounter Date (TED) Operational Data\
      \ Store (ODS). To track programs, CRM utilizes 1) the TRICARE Encounter Data\
      \ Set (TEDS), a financial feeder system through which claims are processed to\
      \ Oracle Federal Financials, 2) the E-Commerce System (ECS), an integrated,\
      \ centralized major system that improves the Agency’s core financial, contracting\
      \ and business process by providing seamless integrated financial and contracting\
      \ systems, and 3) the Oracle Federal Financials (OFF), a financial subsystem\
      \ of the Agency’s ECS.  The OFF system supports budget and accounting/financial\
      \ functions and health care (TEDS) claims processing and contains TRICARE Claims\
      \ Management, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, Purchase Orders and General\
      \ Ledger modules.\n"

    rap6: The Defense Health Agency did not have any Payment Integrity specific budget
      submissions in FY 2022.
    rtp4_2: "The Department cannot establish an effective tolerable rate until the\
      \ Department can produce reliable Payment Integrity estimates for the programs\
      \ that are currently in Phase II. The DoD Office of Inspector General (OIG)\
      \ concluded that the previous Department estimates were unreliable and were\
      \ caused primarily by using an inappropriate variable, which led to insufficient\
      \ sample sizes to pull the Payment Integrity sample population for testing.\
      \ \n\nThe Department has since implemented several DoD OIG recommendations such\
      \ as addressing the Defense Health Agency administrative payments recommendation\
      \ to consider data characteristics. This led to the creation of a separate OMB\
      \ Payment Integrity program that is currently performing a comprehensive risk\
      \ assessment. Additionally, in FY 2023 the Department will restructure the Military\
      \ Health Benefits (MHB) program to align to the specific individual contract\
      \ performance requirements and characteristics. This strategic realignment of\
      \ the MHB program, based on the six different existing contracts that comprise\
      \ the current program, will provide several additional benefits for the Department."

    cyp2_1: Overpayments within the Agency’s control are usually the result of failing
      to access supporting data while the claims are being adjudicated.  For example,
      an overpayment could occur if an outdated version of a pricing schedule is utilized.  Refining
      procedures to ensure all of the correct supporting documentation is available
      and accessed at the time the claim is processed would decrease the risk of future
      improper payments.
