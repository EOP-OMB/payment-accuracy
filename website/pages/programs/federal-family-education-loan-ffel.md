    pro1: 'The Department places a high value on maintaining the integrity of all
      types of payments made to ensure that the billions of dollars in federal funds
      it disburses annually reach intended recipients in the right amount and for
      the right purpose, including for the FFEL program. The Department ensures payment
      integrity by establishing effective policies, business processes, systems, and
      controls over key payment activities, including those pertaining to: payment
      data quality, cash management, banking information, third-party oversight, assessments
      of audit reports, and financial reporting. Accordingly, the Department maintains
      a robust internal control framework that includes over 500 controls designed
      to help prevent, detect, and recover improper payments. In designing controls,
      the Department attempts to strike the right balance between making timely and
      accurate payments and ensuring that controls put in place are not too costly
      or overly burdensome and thereby deter intended beneficiaries from obtaining
      funds they are entitled to receive.'
