    pro1: "The FEMA Tender of Service Program uses bills of lading to acquire freight\
      \ transportation services. The bills of lading, sometimes referred to as a commercial\
      \ bill of lading, establishes the terms of contract between a shipper (i.e.,\
      \ FEMA or other authorized federal agencies) and a Tender of Service Program\
      \ and serves as a receipt of goods, a contract of carriage, and documentary\
      \ evidence of title. FEMA uses an automated, web-based third-party payment system\
      \ to streamline the audit, approval and payment processes associated with transportation-related\
      \ expenses. \n\nFor the testing conducted in 2021, FEMAâ€™s assessment of the\
      \ Commercial Bill of Lading - Disaster Supplemental Funds program was focused\
      \ on the associated FY 2019 disaster supplemental funding disbursements of over\
      \ $18 million applicable for review under PIIA. For additional information on\
      \ the results of this assessment, please refer to the FY 2021 published data\
      \ on paymentaccuracy.gov. FY 2020 and FY 2021 disbursement totals for the Federal\
      \ Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) - Commercial Bill of Lading - Disaster\
      \ Supplemental Funds program dropped below $10M, thus the program is no longer\
      \ eligible for PIIA reporting in the current year."

    rnp3: FEMA Leadership prioritizes the annual PIIA assessments and has high expectations
      of reducing IPs and UPs. FEMA Leadership stresses the importance of being a
      good steward of taxpayer dollars which is trickled down the FEMA levels of hierarchy.
      Root cause analyses are performed at the completion of PIIA testing for each
      program which are used a basis for creating the respective MAPs as well as improving
      the respective internal control environments. Overall, the IPs and UPs are decreasing.
      Additionally, FEMA will be conducting training and require routine meetings
      with stakeholders as needed.

    rap5: Program is reflective of disaster supplemental funding that was received
      by DHS to respond to the Hurricane Harvey, Irma, and Maria disasters that occurred
      in the 2017 / 2018 timeframe. Due to the burden of testing and reporting, Disaster
      Supplemental Funding programs are tested and reported two years in arrears.
      As such, by the time that remedial action is taken and/or is realized in the
      PIIA testing results, the total value of annual disbursements is expected to
      be below the threshold for PIIA action. DHS will continue to make process and
      internal control improvements to improve the payment management processes as
      it relates to supplemental funding but feels that internal control, human capital,
      information system, and infrastructure needs have been met.
