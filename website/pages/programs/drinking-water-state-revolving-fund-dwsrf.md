    pro1: The Drinking Water State Revolving Fund is not susceptible to significant
      improper payments and has been over the last four years. For the DWSRF, the
      agency both identifies and recovers improper payments during the state review
      process. The EPA's Regional offices are required to conduct annual reviews of
      their states' DWSRF programs using checklists developed by the EPA Headquarters.
      Included in the checklist are questions about potential improper payments which
      the Regions discuss with the state DWSRF staff during the reviews. Errors in
      the DWSRF most often arise from duplicate payments, funds drawn from the wrong
      account, incorrect proportionality used for drawing federal funds, ineligible
      expenses, transcription errors, or inadequate cost documentation. Many of the
      payment errors are immediately corrected by the state or are resolved by adjusting
      a subsequent cash draw. For issues requiring more detailed analysis, the state
      provides the agency with a plan for resolving the improper payments and reaches
      an agreement on the planned course of action. The agreement is described in
      EPAâ€™s [state specific] Program Evaluation Report, and the EPA follows up with
      the state to ensure compliance.
