    rnp3: 'The completed corrective actions taken are considered adequate as they
      entailed refresher training for the involved individuals, which emphasized the
      relevant key steps in USAID''s disbursements process to ensure that the individual(s)
      involved are properly trained. Additionally, these refresher trainings emphasized
      the relevant USAID internal policy sections that were pertinent to the error
      that led to the improper payment. By providing thorough and tailored refresher
      trainings to the individuals(s) involved, the corrective actions are considered
      adequate. These corrective actions are considered proportional to the severity
      of the overpayments: the programs FY22 outlays totaled more than $1B, while
      gross improper payments represented less than 1% of those outlays. As such,
      personalized trainings tailored and delivered to the involved individual(s)
      in each instance of an improper payment is considered commensurate with the
      magnitude of the improper payments relative to this program''s total outlays
      in FY22.'

    cyp15: 'Yes'
    cyp20_2: The error rate for FY22 related to this program is less than 1% (0.0126%,
      specifically). The Agency will strive to ensure absolute minimum gross improper
      payments related to this program in the future, and as such is comfortable setting
      0.0126% as the reduction target for FY23.
    rap5: The Agency has an established, robust internal controls system that covers
      all of the Agency's payment streams, that is integrated into the Phoenix financial
      management system. Likewise the Agency ensures that its human capital and information
      system infrastructures are well maintained (e.g. thorough and comprehensive
      trainings, and robust information technology controls). Overall, the Agency
      has what is needed to ensure improper payments and unknown payments are reduced
      to below the tolerable rate of error.
    rap6: The most recent budget submission included OE funds, of which some will
      be utilized to facilitate the continued professional trainings of Agency staff
      to be aware of and strictly adhere to federal laws and regulations as well as
      the Agency's internal policies. In this way, the Agency's internal controls
      are taught to personnel and will, by extension, result in small number of improper/unknown
      payment occurrences.

    cyp2_1: The overpayments in FY22 related to various payment streams, including
      Travel, Allowances, and Payroll. In all instances, the overpayments are inside
      the control of the Agency, as they arose from errors such as duplicate payments,
      overpayments due to lack of complete review before disbursement, etc. They were
      all subsequently rectified through the implementation corrective actions. These
      corrective actions mainly involved closer pre-disbursement reviews and other
      internal controls to prevent future overpayments.
