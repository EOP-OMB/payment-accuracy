    pro1: "Disaster Case Management involves partnerships between a case manager and\
      \ a disaster survivor. The intention of this program is to assess and address\
      \ a survivor’s unmet needs through a disaster recovery plan. This disaster recovery\
      \ plan includes resources, decision-making priorities, providing guidance, and\
      \ tools to assist disaster survivors. \n\nWhile Section 426 of the Stafford\
      \ Act authorizes FEMA to “provide case management services, including financial\
      \ assistance, to State or local government agencies or qualified private organizations\
      \ to provide such services to victims of major disasters to identify and address\
      \ unmet needs,” the Disaster Case Management program is administered in partnership\
      \ with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This partnership provides\
      \ the client with a single person to facilitate access to a broad range of resources.\
      \ The process involves assessing the client’s needs caused by and related to\
      \ the disaster, developing a goal-oriented plan outlining the steps necessary\
      \ for recovery; organizing and coordinating resources that match the client’s\
      \ needs; monitoring progress; and, when necessary, advocating on behalf of the\
      \ client. \n\nFor the testing conducted in 2021, FEMA’s assessment was focused\
      \ on the associated FY 2019 disaster supplemental funding disbursements of over\
      \ $99 million applicable for review under PIIA. For additional information on\
      \ the results of this assessment, please refer to the FY 2021 published data\
      \ on paymentaccuracy.gov.\n\nTesting conducted for the Federal Emergency Management\
      \ Agency (FEMA) - Disaster Case Management - Disaster Supplemental Funds program\
      \ in FY 2022 indicated that the program's estimate error results have moved\
      \ below the OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C guidance threshold to be considered\
      \ susceptible to significant improper payments. In addition, the program's FY\
      \ 2021 outlays have dropped below the $10M threshold."

    rnp3: FEMA Leadership prioritizes the annual PIIA assessments and has high expectations
      of reducing IPs and UPs. FEMA Leadership stresses the importance of being a
      good steward of taxpayer dollars which is trickled down the FEMA levels of hierarchy.
      Root cause analyses are performed at the completion of PIIA testing for each
      program which are used a basis for creating the respective MAPs as well as improving
      the respective internal control environments. Overall, the IPs and UPs are decreasing.
      Additionally, FEMA will be conducting training and require routine meetings
      with stakeholders as needed.

    rnp3: N/A - As the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) - Disaster Case
      Management - Disaster Supplemental Funds program has identified and reported
      an estimated improper and consolidated unknown payments value of below $10M,
      in accordance with OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C, the program is not susceptible
      to significant improper payments and thus will not establish additional corrective
      actions but will continue to execute the completion of open milestones from
      the previously established remediation plan.

    rap5: Program is reflective of disaster supplemental funding that was received
      by DHS to respond to the Hurricane Harvey, Irma, and Maria disasters that occurred
      in the 2017 / 2018 timeframe. Due to the burden of testing and reporting, Disaster
      Supplemental Funding programs are tested and reported two years in arrears.
      As such, by the time that remedial action is taken and/or is realized in the
      PIIA testing results, the total value of annual disbursements is expected to
      be below the threshold for PIIA action. DHS will continue to make process and
      internal control improvements to improve the payment management processes as
      it relates to supplemental funding but feels that internal control, human capital,
      information system, and infrastructure needs have been met.
