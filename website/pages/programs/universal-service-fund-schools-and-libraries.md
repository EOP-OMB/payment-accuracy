  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: USAC, in conjunction with the FCC, will continue to
      implement an Improper Payment Analysis. Through this process, USAC management
      performs an analysis of its improper payments to understand the root cause and
      to identify corrective actions to mitigate the issues. In collaboration with
      USAC management, USAC’s Fraud Risk Group has developed a process to evaluate
      common root causes of improper payments in an effort to identify the true root
      cause to determine if additional corrective action is needed.

    rnp4: 'USAC’s payment recapture audits are known as Beneficiary and Contributor
      Audit Program (BCAP) audits. BCAP audits are designed to identify overpayments
      that must be recovered, assess compliance with FCC rules, and deter waste, fraud,
      and abuse. USAC’s improper payment testing program is known as the Payment

      Quality Assurance (PQA) program. Through PQA, USAC utilizes a statistical sampling
      methodology to estimate the annual amount of improper payments in the USF-HC,
      USF-LL, USF-RHC, and USF-S&L programs.  The goal of the PQA assessment plan
      is to estimate an improper payment error rate based on non-compliance with FCC
      rules. To recover improper payments, USAC has implemented an enterprise recovery
      policy to standardize the reporting and recovery of improper payments. All USAC
      improper payments are deemed collectible and USAC has either recovered or is
      in the process of recovering the improper payments.'

      bidding compliance for the Schools and Libraries Program. The Competitive Bidding
      Portal Request for Proposals (RFP) is currently under review  with the FCC.  However,
      the FCC must first also initiate a proposed rulemaking proceeding to seek public
      feedback for this portal with notice and comment prior to a rulemaking that
      will inform any necessary RFP changes and other requirements for the competitive
      bidding portal.

    rnp3: "The top two causes for this year’s Improper Payments are related to competitive\
      \ bidding and invoicing error issues . As corrective actions, the Schools and\
      \ Libraries team is using data analytics to identify potential competitive bidding\
      \ issues, including potential conflicts of interest, prior to issuing funding\
      \ commitments. The team is also leveraging data analytics to improve competitive\
      \ bidding training and enhance compliance by adding content regarding the minimum\
      \ 28 day waiting period to select service providers, the factors for assessing\
      \ responsive bids, and document retention. \n\nThe Schools and Libraries team\
      \ is also adding additional preventative controls to proactively identify and\
      \ prevent the types of invoicing errors identified in the PQA assessments from\
      \ re-occurring in the future, and providing enhanced training regarding the\
      \ invoicing process.  To further address invoicing-related issues, USAC is transitioning\
      \ the Schools and Libraries program invoicing from the current SL legacy systems\
      \ to EPC, which is expected to help with identifying invoicing issues before\
      \ disbursements are issued.  The transition will occur between November 3 and\
      \ 7, 2023. \n\nThe current improper payment rate of 1.59% is the lowest rate\
      \ in the past eight years. From FY 2016 through FY 2022, the Schools and Libraries\
      \ program’s improper payment rate fluctuated from 2.97% to 6.33%. When considering\
      \ the overpayments within agency control, the Schools and Libraries program’s\

  2024:
    act17_1: USAC, in conjunction with the FCC, has implemented an Improper Payment
      Analysis process. Through this process, USAC management performs an analysis
      of its improper payments to understand the root cause and to identify corrective
      actions to mitigate the issues. In collaboration with USAC management, USAC’s
      Fraud Risk Group has developed a process to evaluate common root causes of improper
      payments in an effort to identify the true root cause to determine if additional
      corrective action is needed.
    act17_2: The most impactful corrective actions are focused on comparing the invoiced
      amount against the payment amount prior to disbursement. The “Pre-Payment Review”
      is considered adequate, as it properly addresses invoicing compliance-related
      issues. The review process is set up as a proactive approach to mitigate future
      potential improper payments related to invoicing errors.
    act17_3: During the Risk Management Council Meeting, management will continue
      to review the improper payments and prioritize the largest monetary impact findings
      accordingly. During the meetings, management has an opportunity to discuss effective
      improper payment mitigation strategies. USAC’s Fraud Risk Group has developed
      a process to evaluate common root causes of improper payments in an effort to
      identify the true root cause to determine if additional corrective action is
      needed. This process has enabled USAC management to institutionalize corrective
      actions as part of its program integrity efforts, which will prevent future
      instances of improper payments. USAC leadership is implementing a quarterly
      review process to discuss progress towards executing these corrective actions.   The
      results of the strategy are clear with the reduction of the improper payment
      rate to 1.27%, which is under the threshold of 1.50%.
    rnp3: "The Schools and Libraries team is using data analytics to identify potential\
      \ competitive bidding issues.  Data analytics will be used to identify potential\
      \ conflicts of interest, prior to issuing funding commitments. The team is also\
