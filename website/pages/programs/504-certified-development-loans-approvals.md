  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: SBA provided training at lender conferences in order
      to provide lenders an understanding of the most common root causes of the improper
      payments.  SBA recently updated its loan making Standard Operating Procedure
      (SOP) and provided training to Lenders.  SBA provides regular feedback to Loan
      Center management and staff regarding Improper Payments, Root Causes, and Corrective
      Actions. Quality Control and Quality Assurance staff for 9 of SBA's 10 reporting
      programs meet regularly to discuss improper payment related issues that may
      be common to all teams.

  2024:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Specific corrective actions are determined based upon
      the primary reason for the error, with the purpose of both remedying the error
      and preventing recurrence. SBA plans to continue external training for CDC lenders
      to ensure that appropriate documentation is obtained and analyzed prior to loan
      approval and that policy requirements are met.

    rnp3: Corrective Actions are structured based on the Root Cause of the Improper
      Payment.  Root causes are shared with management throughout the review cycle.  Corrective
      Actions, such as External training, are formulated to address root causes of
      improper payments.  Collaboration and communication with other offices within
      SBA about improper payments focuses on specific loans, lenders, and root causes
      of the improper payment.

    act17_3: null
    rnp3: Management provides oversight to ensure milestones are met. All improper
      payments identified as a result of the FY 2022 PIIA reviews have been resolved
      through obtaining additional documentation, loan modification, or cancellation
      of the loan. Corrective actions were generally completed at the loan level within
      180 days with all actions taken by the end of the fiscal year.

    rnp3: "Because 504 loans are usually reviewed prior to monies being disbursed,\
      \ resolution of an identified improper payment is usually through obtaining\
      \ additional documentation from the CDC to remedy the potential improper payment\
      \ or through cancellation of the loan. There is no monetary outlay at approval,\
      \ and thus no loss to the Federal Government. Specific corrective actions on\
      \ loans reviewed are tracked at the loan level through a centralized database.\
      \  SBA anticipates that training and internal collaboration will continue to\
      \ be effective.  \n\n"
  2024:
    act17_1: "To reduce or eliminate the occurrence of future improper payments, a\
      \ Corrective Action Plan has been formalized for the 504 approval center. Specific\
      \ corrective actions are determined based upon the primary reason for the improper\
      \ payment with the purpose of both remedying the improper payment and preventing\
      \ recurrence. \n\nPlans for improvement include the following: \n•\tCollaborating\
      \ with the Office of Credit Risk Management (OCRM) to recommend that specific\
      \ lender deficiencies be monitored and incorporated into Risk Based Reviews;\
      \ \n•\tCollaborating with the Office of Financial Assistance (OFA) to inform\
      \ the office of deficiencies identified for potential incorporation into policy,\
      \ regulatory, or standard operating procedure rewrite or update; and \n•\tExternal\
      \ training for lenders to ensure that appropriate documentation is obtained\

    act17_3: The corrective actions are currently in process.  SBA will continue to
      share the loan level and lender deficiencies identified during the reviews with
      the OFA and the OCRM.  SBA will also continue its efforts to ensure that CDC
      deficiencies are monitored.

    cyp20_2: The FY 2022 improper payment rate estimate of 1.99 percent for this program
      is less than the target reduction rate of 2.97 percent from FY 2021.   Because
      the lower bound of its confidence interval, 0.21 percent, is lower than the
      reduction target of 2.97 percent, in accordance with OMB Appendix C to Circular
      A-123 (March 2021), the 504 loan guaranty approval program is considered to
      have met the reduction target. For FY 2023, the SBA established a reduction
      target of 1.89 percent for the 504 Certified Development Loans Approvals program.
    rap5: The agency has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human capital
      and information system and other infrastructure to reduce improper payments
      and unknown payments to the tolerable rate.
    rap6: No resources are being requested in the most recent budget submission of
      the agency to establish and maintain the internal controls.
    rtp4_2: The SBA has not conducted the analysis to determine what an acceptable
      tolerable rate should be for this program. in FY 2023, the SBA will explore
      the potential in establishing a tolerable rate for this program.

    rap5: The agency has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human capital
      and information system and other infrastructure to reduce Improper Payments
      and Unknown Payments.
    rap6: No additional resources for this program were requested.

    cyp20_2: The FY 2025 Reduction Targets established for 504 Loan Approvals is the
      lesser of the established tolerable rate, or the current reported improper payment
      rate (i.e., if the FY 2024 improper payment rate is less than the established
      tolerable rate, the FY 2024 improper payment rate will be the reduction target).
    rap5: The agency has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human capital
      and information system and other infrastructure to reduce improper payments
      and unknown payments to the tolerable rate
    rap6: No additional resources were requested in the most recent budget submission
