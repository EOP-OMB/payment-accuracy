Actions_By_Year:
  2023:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: USAC, in conjunction with the FCC, will continue to
      implement an Improper Payment Analysis process. Through this process, USAC management
      performs an analysis of its improper payments to understand the root cause and
      to identify corrective actions to mitigate the issues. In collaboration with
      USAC management, the USAC’s Fraud Risk Group will continue to evaluate common
      root causes in an effort to identify the true root cause to determine if additional
      corrective action is needed.

  2022:
    pro1: For the FY2022 reporting cycle, FCC concluded, with OMB consultation, that
      it would be best if the Universal Service Fund - High Cost program to remain
      in Phase 1 in FY 2022 reporting cycle until OIG recommended revised testing
      procedures could be fully tested in order to determine the most accurate improper
      payment rate.  FCC did not want to mislead any users of this information before
      our new testing procedures was fully completed.  As OMB is very well aware,
      the High Cost program itself is very complex.  To comply with new OIG recommendations
      in our testing to determine the most accurate improper payment rate, it has
      taken significantly more time than we had originally anticipated.  At this juncture,
      FCC is comfortable that the new transaction testing will be completed within
      next few months, which will allow us to provide a more accurate improper payment
      rate for the High Cost program in the FY 2023 reporting cycle.  As stated above,
      when FCC made this determination, we consulted OMB and OMB informed us that
      FCC could use a testing period longer than 12-month similar to what other agencies
      have been doing.  Based on our actual experience of testing the new OIG recommended
      procedures, testing is definitely taking longer to complete.  As a result, the
      FCC determined it should use a 18-month reporting cycle for the High Cost program.  We’ll
      see if we can reduce the testing period as we gain more experience with the
      new testing procedures.

    rnp4: 'USAC’s payment recapture audits are the known as Beneficiary and Contributor
      Audit Program (BCAP). BCAP audits are designed to identify overpayments that
      must be recaptured, assess compliance with FCC rules, and deter waste, fraud,
      and abuse. USAC’s improper payment testing program is known as Payment

      Quality Assurance (PQA). Through PQA, USAC utilizes a statistical sampling methodology
      to estimate the annual amount of improper payments in the USF-HC, USF-LL, USF-RHC,
      and USF-S&L programs.  The goal of the PQA assessment plan is to estimate an
      improper payment error rate based on non-compliance with FCC rules. To recover
      improper payments, USAC has implemented an enterprise recovery policy to standardize
      the reporting and recovery of improper payments. All USAC improper payments
      are deemed collectible and USAC has either recovered or is in the process of
      recovering the improper payments.'

      Payment Analysis process. Through this process, USAC management performs an

      action is needed.
    act17_2: USAC, in collaboration with the FCC, will continue to effectively implement
      and prioritize strategies to reduce the improper payments. USAC will continue
      to increase program efforts focused on keeping the policies and procedures updated
      along with training materials. We will continue to review the strategies to
      ensure adequate impact to the improper payments.
    act17_3: During the Risk Management Council Meeting, management will continue
      to review the improper payments and prioritize the largest monetary impact findings
      accordingly. During the meetings, management has an opportunity to discuss effective
      improper payment mitigation strategies. USAC’s Fraud Risk Group has developed
      a process to evaluate common root causes of improper payments in an effort to
      identify the true root cause to determine if additional corrective action is
      needed. This process has enabled USAC management to institutionalize corrective
      actions as part of its program integrity efforts, which will prevent future
      instances of improper payments. USAC leadership is implementing a quarterly
      review process to discuss progress towards executing these corrective actions.
    rnp3: The High Cost Program will continue to focus on program integrity assurance
      (PIA) activities to mitigate improper payments. The PIA activities include collaborating
      with USAC's Audit and Assurance Division partners to provide the annual Circle
      of Life webinars, meeting with NECA monthly, and continue existing analysis
      and data validation for legacy funds. The annual Circle of Life webinar references
      FCC rules and provides common error examples and recommends best practices to
      avoid these findings.  The monthly NECA meeting is used by High Cost to evaluate
      processes based on audit finding feedback. With the annual data validation,
      High Cost compares projected and actual cost study data that determines carriers'
      support. The High Cost Program team will introduce a new compliance layer by
      developing additional PIA procedures leveraging enhanced analytics and testing
      capabilities on a sample basis to identify potential violations.
