  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: "The identified Training corrective actions aim to reduce\
      \ the unknown payments. Eligibility Tier testing revealed significant difficulties\
      \ in retrieving evidence from the contract administrators to timely support\
      \ tenant eligibility and any error rate estimation would be misleading based\
      \ on a lack of precision in an extrapolating error rate. As corrective actions,\
      \ HUD continued its training efforts to improve contract administrators’ timely\
      \ evidence organization, retention, collection, and submission through training\
      \ and outreach. The identified corrective actions will provide knowledge to\
      \ the Owners/Agents on their role in the testing process. Due to the absence\
      \ of adequate documentation from the Owners/Agents to substantiate the payments,\
      \ $45.24 million of unknown payments are being reported in FY24. With improved\
      \ understanding and support regarding the documentation requirements, Owners/Agents\
      \ will have additional knowledge to furnish the correct documents timely and\
      \ reduce the extrapolated error.  \n\nEligibility Tier payments are not being\
      \ reported in the FY 2024 Payment Integrity. Therefore, root cause and corrective\
      \ action determinations would be premature in this reporting cycle. That said,\
      \ HUD will utilize the lessons learned during the Payee Tier testing during\
      \ the Eligibility testing."

  2023:
    pro1: 'Based on guidance from OMB on 10/25/2022, HUD did not report improper payment
      estimates for rental assistance programs TBRA and PBRA as the full payment lifecycle
      could not be verified and testing was unable to be completed. HUD was unable
      to produce estimates due to limitations in obtaining supporting documentation
      needed for testing in a timely manner for FY 2022 disbursements. Without estimates,
      HUD could not determine whether its improper payment plus unknown payment estimate
      was below or above the statutory threshold. As a result, HUD could not implement
      corrective actions and other OMB requirements for programs above the statutory
      threshold. HUD did not perform testing of the full payment cycle for RHAP -
      TBRA and PBRA related to FY 2022 payments due to lack of compliance readiness,
      including: need of further training of personnel at all levels of the payment
      cycle, resource limitations, key person dependencies, and the delay of full
      implementation of corrective actions around privacy and security concerns. Due
      to this scope limitation, HUD is not reporting an error rate for PBRA and TBRA
      for the FY 2023 reporting cycle. Target date is FY2027, dependent on funding.'

    act17_1: 'The level of IP and UP are below HUD''s payment integrity testing for
      the complex multi-layered PBRA processes requires a sophisticated approach to
      effectively assess risk. The greatest risk of improper payments occurs outside
      of HUD''s direct control. The variability in payment controls and documentation
      significantly increases the complexity and risk when testing the full payment
      lifecycle, a high-risk area identified by both HUD and the Office of Inspector
      General (OIG). The identified corrective actions aim to reduce the unknown payments.
      They will provide knowledge to the Owners/Agents on their role in the testing
      process. Due to the absence of adequate documentation from the Owners/Agents
      to substantiate the payments, resulted in the identification of the unknown
      payments In FY24. With improved understanding and support regarding the documentation
      requirements, Owners/Agents will have additional knowledge to furnish the correct
      documents, thereby significantly reducing the number of unknown payments.  If
      Owners/Agents understand and are able to provide the correct documents this
      could potentially reduce the extrapolated error in the statutory level of improper
      payments.

      on training Owners/Agents on what is required from them to verify payments.
      These trainings will be prioritized and implemented early in the FY25 testing
