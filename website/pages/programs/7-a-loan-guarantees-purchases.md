      in unknown payments totals 4.22 percent.  Because the lower bound of its confidence
      interval, 1.76 percent, is lower than the reduction target rate of 3.25 percent,
      in accordance with OMB Appendix C to Circular A-123 (March 2021), the 7(a) loan
      guaranty purchase program is considered to have met its reduction target. For
      FY 2023, the SBA established a reduction target of 4.05 percent for the 7(a)
      loan guaranty purchases program.
