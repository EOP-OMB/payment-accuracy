      \ in FY 2025 analyzing the latest payment integrity results and determining\

  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: "•\tAmeriCorps had previously established a Payment\
      \ Integrity Corrective Action Plan working group to address improper payment\
      \ rates. This group identified the root cause drivers behind the improper and\
      \ unknown payments. Based on this information, the group has created resources\
      \ and delivered trainings focused on the identified improper payment root cause\
      \ drivers. Those trainings are and have been available to grantees.  The agency\
      \ also provided resolution packets to grantees at the conclusion of the FY 2024\
      \ assessment linking specific root cause drivers of improper payments to the\
      \ corresponding applicable statute, regulation, and available trainings."

    rnp4: The agency implemented an improper payment reduction corrective action plan
      group to develop actions to reduce the improper payments and this group will
      be reinstated in FY 2025. This group consisted of representatives from offices
      across the agency. Through root cause analysis and corrective action plan development,
      the agency is assessing where additional controls may be necessary to reduce
      improper payments. The improper payments reported for the agency are made at
      the grantee level, therefore the agency is developing an internal control training
      to strengthen the control environment at the grantee level. Executive managers,
      programs, and other staff contribute to improper payment corrective action planning.
      Reduction in improper payments may be included in performance conversations
      for those accountable for the reduction.

  2024:
    act17_1: "The internal control training will target root causes in both unknown\
      \ and overpayment categories to address adequate record keeping and controls\
      \ to ensure payments are correct and correctly recorded. \n\nRegarding the provision\
      \ of training as a corrective action, AmeriCorps will reestablish the Payment\
      \ Integrity Corrective Action Plan working group to identify corrective actions\
      \ the agency could take to address its improper payment rate. Utilizing improper\
      \ and unknown payments information from AmeriCorps’ annual Payment Integrity\
      \ Assessment, the working group will identify the root cause drivers behind\
      \ the improper and unknown payments. Based on this information, the group will\
      \ implement additional action steps aimed at reducing these areas of non-compliance.\
      \ The training and resources focus on the identified improper payment root cause\
      \ drivers. \n"
    act17_2: It is essential that grantees have access to training and resources that
      provide information on financial grants management. Having effective and readily
      available resources to guide grantees in program implementation promotes effective
      stewardship of federal funds and reduce non-compliance.  The created resources
      build upon the agency’s currently available tools and focus specifically on
      areas of non-compliance.
    act17_3: "•\tAs part of its strategic plan, AmeriCorps is prioritizing effective\
      \ stewardship of federal resources. This goal includes the objective of reducing\
      \ the agency’s improper payments via an agency-wide corrective action plan.\
      \ The prior establishment of the working group represents a coordinated effort\
      \ by the agency to develop and implement corrective actions aimed at reducing\
      \ improper payments. The agency performs root cause analysis to determine why\
      \ improper payments are occurring at the grantee level. This allows for more\
      \ targeted actions."
    rnp3: "The agency is committed to the compliance with PIIA as demonstrated by\
      \ the agency elevating the reduction of improper payments to be a key performance\
      \ indicator in its strategic plan. \n\nThe improper payments reported in ASN\
      \ and FGP are made that the grantee level. The improper payments in ASN and\
      \ FGP are not made at the agency level and largely do not represent monetary\
      \ loss to the government. The majority are unknown payments for which the agency’s\
      \ grantees are unable to provide sufficient support documentation to determine\
      \ if the payment was proper or improper. Since the agency does not have direct\
      \ control over the payments, it has implemented updated trainings to ensure\
      \ the grantees have the requisite knowledge to appropriately support their payments.\n\
      \nThe NST rate is under the statutory threshold and will not report a rate in\
      \ FY2025. However the improper payments identified are almost entirely related\
      \ to National Service Criminal History Checks and retaining adequate documentation\
      \ by grantee. Corrective actions to address these same root causes for ASN will\
      \ also apply to the NST.\n"

    cyp20_2: A reduction target was not set, as NST will not report in FY 2025.
    rap5: As part of its strategic plan, AmeriCorps is prioritizing effective stewardship
      of federal resources. This goal includes the objective of reducing the agency’s
      improper payments via five-pronged approach. Via the strategic plan that agency
      is committing resources – human capital, internal controls, and information
      systems, to reduce improper payments.
    rap6: No resources were requested. The agency did not request resources because
      the payments are generally not made at the agency level and are made by individual
      grantees. Corrective actions to target grantees, such as trainings, can be developed
      and performed with resources available.

    cyp7_ucp4_1: The AmeriCorps Payment Integrity Assessment uses documentation submitted
      by grantees and agency-maintained documentation to support the National Service
      Trust disbursement of education awards. There are situations where the grantee
      is unable to provide the required documentation to support the payment or the
      documentation provided is insufficient. In these situations, had the grantee
      been able to provide the missing documentation or adequately documented information
      a determination regarding the payment as either proper or improper could have
      been made.  The specific documentation that was lacking pertained to missing/incomplete
      National Service Criminal History Check information for all improper payments
      within the control of grantees. One payment in with NST where the documentation
      at the agency level was unavailable related to a drug screening, and a determination
      as to whether the payment was proper or improper was not able to be made.
    cyp8: "For disbursements related to grantee-managed members: Grantees are required\
      \ by statute to certify when a member’s service is complete and that they are\
      \ eligible to receive an education award. AmeriCorps must rely upon this certification\
      \ to disburse education awards from the NST. Post payment reviews of full member\
      \ files may result in the discovery of incomplete or non-complaint files that\
      \ may be identified as improper or unknown disbursement. The results of the\
      \ testing revealed situations where the grantee was unable to provide the required\
      \ documentation to support the payment and/or the documentation provided was\
      \ insufficient. In these situations, had the grantee been able to provide the\
      \ missing documentation or adequately documented information a determination\
      \ regarding the payment as either proper or improper could have been made. \
      \ \n\nFor disbursements related to agency-managed members: There was one payment\
      \ in with NST where the documentation at the agency level was unavailable, and\
      \ a determination as to whether the payment was proper or improper was not able\
      \ to be made.\n"
