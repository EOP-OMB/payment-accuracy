      their due diligence requirements regarding the American Opportunity Tax Credit
      (AOTC), through venues such as the annual IRS Nationwide Tax Forums and the
      Latino Tax Fest. These events provide a platform for the IRS to reach a broad
      audience of tax preparers, helping them understand their obligations when assisting
      taxpayers in claiming the AOTC. This is important because a root cause of AOTC
      improper payments is misunderstanding the eligibility criteria for the credit.
      Because tax preparers assist in filing returns claiming refundable tax credits
      (RTCs), any lack of awareness or lack of oversight at the preparer level has
      a cascading effect on improper payments. Training will help clarify what is
      required to substantiate claims, such as documentation for qualifying educational
      expenses. The IRS is re-aligning its efforts to further its strategic initiatives;
      accordingly, the IRS is investing in taxpayer outreach and education, in lieu
      of conducting additional pre-refund audits. By helping taxpayers file accurate
      returns upfront, quickly fixing errors that delay refunds and ensuring taxpayers
      claim the credits and deductions for which they are eligible, the IRS will correct

      requirements regarding the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC). This training
      was delivered through prominent venues, including the annual IRS Nationwide
      Tax Forums and the Latino Tax Fest. These events provided a platform for the

      obligations when assisting taxpayers in claiming the AOTC. The training focused
      on specific key due diligence requirements, such as verifying that educational
      expenses being claimed were eligible for the credit, ensuring that the taxpayer
      or their dependent was enrolled in a qualifying educational institution and
      understanding the income limits associated with the credit. The IRS is investing
      in outreach and education of tax preparers and taxpayers, in lieu of conducting

      with other federal agencies and outreach/education efforts are adequate measures
      because they will continue to aid the Service in mitigating the impact of the
      root causes. Much of the difficulty administering the American Opportunity Tax
      Credit (AOTC) derives from the complexity of its statutory eligibility requirements,
      many of which are known only to the taxpayer and cannot be independently confirmed
      using third-party corroborating data. Likewise, the primary root causes of improper
      payments of the AOTC are the  inability to authenticate eligibility at return
      filing because the data needed does not exist, and taxpayer income misreporting
      related to self-employment income and other income where the income is not reported
      to the IRS by a third party. Nevertheless, the IRS has a strong and effective
      internal control environment around refundable tax credit programs and makes
      decisions based on overall cost-benefit considerations.

      taxpayer misrepresentation or misunderstanding of key points of eligibility,
      especially for self-employment or other income not reported to the IRS by third-parties;
      and (3) the inability for the IRS to wholesale deny refunds. Because of these
      root causes, the IRS has to rely on taxpayer self-certification of an accurate
      return. The IRS has implemented a series of corrective actions focused on mitigating
      these root causes. The annual Dependent Database (DDb) meetings focus on reviewing
      and adjusting compliance filters used in audit selection, which allows the IRS
      to detect errors earlier. The IRS also cross-collaborates with the Department
      of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Social Security Administration (SSA)
      and the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) to share data that would
      enable the IRS to identify discrepancies in taxpayer claims. Finally, the IRS
      has invested in taxpayer education and outreach efforts, through such venues
      as the IRS''s Nationwide Tax Forums and Latino Tax Fest, to educate tax preparers
      about their responsibilities to verify taxpayer eligibility before filing claims.

      causes of improper payments by improving the accuracy of filed returns and mitigating
      the risks associated with taxpayer self-certification.'
    act17_2: The regulatory structure of refundable tax credits (RTCs), which lacks

      that its corrective actions are continuously monitored, effectively implemented
      and reprioritized based on their ability to address the root causes of RTC improper
      payments.
    rnp3: 'The challenge in administering refundable tax credits (RTCs) is that RTCs
      do not have the characteristics of a typical payment program. The fundamental
      root cause of RTC improper payments are as follows: (1) there is a statutory
      lack of a required pre-approval process; (2) an inability to wholesale deny
      payments (refunds) and (3) the information needed to verify taxpayer claims
      of eligibility belongs primarily to the taxpayer without any third-party data
      source available at the time of filing, thus requiring the IRS to rely on taxpayer
      self-certification that all return information is accurate. RTCs are managed
      within and follow the regulatory scheme of tax administration and enforcement.
      At a lower level, the root causes are that, at the time of filing/payment: (a)
      there is an inability to authenticate eligibility (typically due to a series
      of complex eligibility rules, many with relationship and residency tests containing
      with many nuances); (b) there are instances where taxpayer income is misreported,
      particularly related to self-employment income and other income not reported
      to the IRS by a third party; and (c) there is turnover of taxpayers who receive
      certain credits for the first time and fail to understand the complex requirements
      of claiming the credit. Pursuant to federal statute, the IRS generally does
      not have the capability to deny even incorrect claims, given the lack of math
      authority. However, the IRS''s information technology platform includes a number
      of filters that the IRS uses to monitor the accuracy of compliance with eligibility
      rules and payment certification. The annual Dependent Database (DDb) meetings,
      collaborations/data sharing with other federal agencies, and outreach/education
      efforts aid the IRS in mitigating the impact of these root causes. Lastly, the
      IRS has a number of outreach and education programs in place, to help taxpayers
      and tax preparers understand the program eligibility rules and file accurate
      returns claiming RTCs.'
Description: The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) is a credit for qualified
  education expenses paid for an eligible student for the first four years of higher
  education. Approximately $0.53B of AOTC overclaims are from the inability to authenticate
  eligibility because the data needed does not exist. This root cause includes errors
  that IRS can only verify via audit since no data exists to support automated compliance
  checks. Approximately $0.90B of AOTC overclaims are from program design limitations.
  Errors caused by program design occur when information needed to confirm payment
  accuracy is not available at the time the return is processed.

    cyp20_2: The FY 2023 Estimated Improper Payment Rate is the same as the FY 2022
      Improper Payment Rate. The unique nature of tax administration means that traditional
      target-setting as a means of approaching reductions in RTC improper payments
      will be ineffective. The RTC statute is such that IRS has limited authority
      to make changes to the claims during return processing. More so, most of the
      eligibility and credit determination requirements depends on factors that are
      not fundamentally known by the IRS at the time of filing. The IRS heavily relies
      on taxpayer-provided information without verifiability by third-party sources.
      The complexity of the law contributes to confusion around eligibility requirements
      and is one of the major contributing factors of improper payments. Error prevention
      and recoveries are achieved through time-consuming and resource-intensive examinations
      and other compliance activities. IRS does not have the resources to audit every
      return claiming RTCs, and the adjustments able to be attained through this process
      are small relative to the amount of improper payments estimated for the program.
      Without legislative change to greatly improve effective tools to administer
      these credits, the improper payment rate will not drastically change.
    rap5: 'To reduce overclaim rates to less than 10 percent, to meet Payment Integrity
      Information Act (PIIA) compliance standards, the IRS estimated, in a Fiscal
      Year 2021 study, that it would need additional or reallocated resources of $2.5
      billion to audit 4.2 million additional RTC returns in the pre-refund environment.
      If the IRS must reallocate enforcement resources to be compliant with PIIA,
      a substantial loss in enforcement revenue, estimated at $6.4 billion, would
      result because the IRS would divert resources from more valuable programs and
      tax gap elements to audits of RTC returns. Moreover, such enforcement actions
      would place substantial burden on low-income taxpayers through increased audits
      and delayed refunds, violating the IRS requirement of enforcing the tax law
      with integrity and fairness. As such, IRS has long held that focusing enforcement
      resources on the larger tax gap is a more efficient and

      cost effective way to minimize the tax gap and maximize tax collections. We
      further support the reporting of RTC overclaims within the Tax Gap Analysis
      to reflect better how the IRS approaches taxpayer compliance relative to the
      U.S. tax system.'
    rap6: "For  FY 2023 , the Administration included the following proposals in its\
      \ Budget submission:\n\n(1) Increase Oversight of Paid Tax Return Preparers.\n\
      The proposal would amend Title 31, U.S. Code (Money and Finance) to provide\
      \ the Secretary with explicit authority to regulate all paid preparers of Federal\
      \ tax returns, including by establishing mandatory minimum competency standards.\n\
      \n(2) Expand and increase penalties for return preparation and e-filing – \n\
      The proposal would increase and expand the IRS’s authority to address noncompliance\
      \ or inappropriate behavior by paid tax return preparers and e-file providers.\
      \ First, it would increase the penalty amounts that apply to paid tax return\
      \ preparers for willful, reckless or unreasonable understatements, as well as\
      \ for forms of noncompliance that do not involve an understatement of tax. Second,\
      \ the proposal would establish new penalties for the appropriation of Preparer\
      \ Tax Identification Numbers (PTINs) and Electronic Filing Identification\n\
      Numbers (EFINs) and for failing to disclose the use of a paid tax return preparer.\
      \ Third, the proposal would increase the limitations period during which the\
      \ penalty for a failure to furnish the preparer’s identifying number may be\
      \ assessed from three years to six years. Fourth, the proposal would clarify\
      \ the\nSecretary’s authority to regulate the conduct and suitability of persons\
      \ who participate in the authorized e-file program, including setting standards\
      \ and imposing sanctions to protect the integrity of the e-file program."
    rtp4_2: Treasury and IRS analyses have consistently found that refundable tax
      credit (RTC) overclaims are largely attributable to the statutory design and
      complex eligibility requirements, and not rooted in internal control weaknesses,
      financial management deficiencies, or reporting failures.

    cyp20_2: The FY 2024 estimated improper payment rate is the same as the FY 2023
      improper payment rate. The unique nature of tax administration means that traditional
      target-setting as a means of approaching reductions in refundable tax credit
      (RTC) improper payments will be ineffective. The RTC statute is such that IRS
      has limited authority to make changes to the claims during return processing.
      More so, most of the eligibility and credit determination requirements depends
      on factors that are generally not known by the IRS at the time of filing. The
      IRS heavily relies on taxpayer provided information without verifiability by
      third-party sources. The complexity of the law contributes to confusion around
      eligibility requirements and is one of the major contributing factors to improper
      payments. Error prevention and recoveries are achieved through time-consuming
      and resource-intensive examinations and other compliance activities. IRS does
      not have the resources to audit every return claiming RTCs, and the adjustments
      able to be attained through this process are small relative to the amount of
      improper payments estimated for the program. Without legislative change to greatly
      improve effective tools to administer these credits, the improper payment rate
      will not change significantly.
    rap5: The IRS has what is needed with respect to internal control, human capital
      and information system and other infrastructure to reduce American Opportunity
      Tax Credit (AOTC) Improper Payments and Unknown Payments to a tolerable rate.
      The issue with AOTC is statutory program design and reliance on taxpayer self-certification.
      The IRS has a strong internal control environment around AOTC and makes decisions
      based on overall cost-benefit considerations, with a well-trained, technically
      capable program staff.
    rap6: The IRS is realigning resources internally to accelerate progress against
      its strategic priorities. The IRS will substantially be reducing the number
      of correspondence audits focused specifically on certain refundable credits,
      including the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC). Focusing on helping taxpayers
      submit accurate filings upfront will increase payment accuracy while reducing
      administrative burdens for the IRS and the tax filer.
    rtp4_2: Similar to the previous year, IRS has not yet determined a tolerable rate.
      Reducing the improper payment rate to less than 10 percent would require significant
      restructuring of the RTC programs, to include legislative action. Accordingly,
      the IRS does not have a current target date to report the tolerable rate.

      The IRS has a strong internal control environment around RTCs and makes decisions

      Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) has traditionally reported
      that the issue with improper payments is not an internal control deficiency.

      restructuring of the RTC programs, to include legislative action.'
    rap6: "Further improving the integrity of refundable tax credit (RTC) programs\

      \ authority to regulate all paid preparers of federal tax returns, including\
      \ by establishing mandatory minimum competency standards. \n\nThese statutory\
      \ changes may help reduce RTC errors to some degree.  However, a meaningful\
      \ reduction in the estimated error rate is unlikely without independent data\
      \ sources through which the IRS can verify taxpayer-provided information and\
      \ additional time and resources for the IRS to address any issues identified."
    rtp4_2: "Similar to previous years, reporting a tolerable rate has not been determined\
      \ for the American Opportunity Tax Credit. It is important to note the Refundable\
      \ Tax Credits (RTCs) do not have the characteristics of a typical payment program.\
      \ The primary root causes of improper payments of RTCs are the inability to\
      \ authenticate eligibility at return filing because the data needed does not\
      \ exist, and taxpayer income misreporting related to self-employment income\
      \ and other income where the income is not reported to the IRS by a third party.\
      \ Put simply, payment eligibility and certification decisions for RTCs are made\
      \ by the taxpayer during the filing process. \n\nReducing the improper payment\

      \ RTC programs, to include legislative action. Accordingly, the IRS does not\
