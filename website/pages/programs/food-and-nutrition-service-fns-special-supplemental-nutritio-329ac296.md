  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: The mitigation strategy for the Food and Nutrition Service
      (FNS) Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children
      (WIC) is to provide additional guidance on vendor cost containment which will
      be designed to increase compliance which could reduce improper payments. FNS
      uses management evaluations (MEs) as its primary oversight tool. MEs enforce
      program integrity by assessing WIC state agency compliance with requirements
      and provides technical assistance to agencies. ME materials are continuously
      being reviewed, improved, and updated. The ME process supports integrity in
      the WIC Program through the timely resolution of issues that could result in
      improper payments.

    Description_Action_Taken: Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has implemented several
      opportunities of training for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for
      Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Annual training is provided on FNS’ National
      Management Evaluation (ME) guidance to regional office staff who conduct MEs.
      The goal of this training to establish standards for FNS to effectively communicate
      findings and corrective action expectations to State agencies, to provide necessary
      technical assistance, and to support State agency program improvements. Additional
      WIC specific ME training is conducted throughout the year to support regional
      staff by holding bi-monthly meetings to discuss best practices and provide technical
      assistance, as well as specific technical assistance as needed to improve understanding
      and compliance of ME activities. Additional training is provided to state agencies
      through specific technical assistance during oversight activities. Training
      activities for State agency staff are further identified through the results
      of an annual target area report. This report looks at national trends of program
      integrity issues as well as programmatic deficiencies across all State agencies
      to issue technical assistance, policy memos, and training as needed. FNS has
      also recently released several resources for WIC State agencies that target
      improvement in the areas of vendor management and certification. These resources
      include the WIC Vendor Management and Food Delivery Handbook, a new toolkit
      on assessing and developing WIC Vendor Peer Group Systems, and an updated tool
      for assessing WIC Vendor Cost Neutrality.

    Description_Action_Taken: A prime example of Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)
      Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)
      implementing corrective actions are through WIC oversight. FNS uses management
      evaluations (MEs) as its primary oversight tool. MEs assure program integrity
      by assessing WIC State agency compliance with Program requirements, evaluating
      the accomplishment of WIC Program objectives, and providing technical assistance
      to State Agencies and supporting efforts to improve and innovate. In FY 2020-2024,
      FNS' ME target area for WIC is Nutrition Services. Delivering high quality nutrition
      services is essential to carrying out the Program's mission. The Nutrition Services
      ME examines how State agencies plan for and deliver nutrition services, including
      nutrition and breastfeeding education. In addition to the ME target area, FNS
      also conducts a national risk-based ME assessment to identify State agencies
      with known program integrity issues. Program integrity issues include issues
      relating to improper payments, vendor management, certification/eligibility,
      fraud, or any other issue that poses a high monetary values risk to the Program.
      The FY 2020-2024 Target Area also include a focus on updating existing ME materials
      and technology. The target area supports the United States Department of Agriculture
      (USDA) and FNS priorities related to providing high quality customer service
      to WIC State agency partners, as well as ensuring integrity in the WIC Program
      through the timely resolution of issues identified through MEs. FNS continues
      to analyze ME data to identify opportunities to improve program administration
      and integrity. This includes addressing certification and vendor issues that
      could result in improper payments.

    Description_Action_Taken: The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) Special Supplemental
      Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) implements corrective
      actions through WIC oversight. FNS uses Management Evaluations (MEs) as its
      primary oversight tool. MEs assure program integrity by assessing WIC State
      agency compliance with Program requirements, evaluating the accomplishment of
      WIC Program objectives, and providing technical assistance to State agencies
      and supporting efforts to improve and innovate. MEs enforce program integrity
      by assessing WIC State agency compliance with regulation, policy, procedure
      and provide technical assistance to agencies. ME materials are continuously
      being reviewed, improved, and updated. The ME process supports integrity in
      the WIC Program through the timely resolution of issues that could result in
      improper payments. In addition to program oversight through these MEs, FNS provides
      guidance and technical assistance to support program operations and oversight,
      including guidance on vendor cost containment which is designed to increase
      compliance which could reduce improper payments.

  2024:
    act17_1: The mitigation strategy for the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is to
      provide additional guidance on vendor cost containment which will be designed
      to increase compliance which could reduce improper payments. FNS uses management
      evaluations (MEs) as its primary oversight tool. MEs enforce program integrity
      by assessing the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants,
      and Children (WIC) state agency compliance with requirements and provide technical
      assistance to agencies. ME materials are continuously being reviewed, improved,
      and updated. The ME process supports integrity in the WIC program through the
      timely resolution of issues that could result in improper payments.
    act17_2: Program specific training on program regulations, policies, and guidance
      is provided to the Food and Nutrition Service(FNS) and State agency staff of
      the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children
      (WIC). Policies and guidance, such as memos and handbooks, cover both root causes
      of certification and vendor errors. If FNS oversight activities of WIC State
      agencies’ operations reveal specific problems in these or any other Program
      functional areas, it's addressed through a corrective action plan and monitored
      until implementation and all issues are resolved.
    act17_3: The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) regularly conducts training and
      evaluates effectiveness of training and oversight of the Special Supplemental
      Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) via management evaluations
      (MEs). When FNS identifies errors immediate feedback and technical assistance
      is provided to the State agency. When issues are identified during a ME it is
      the priority of FNS that they be addressed timely. State agencies are required
      to submit a corrective action plan for ME findings within 60 calendar days.
      FNS will then respond to the corrective plan within 20 calendar days. FNS monitors
      each corrective action until it is fully implemented. FNS verifies the implementation
      before closing the finding.
    rnp3: The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) uses management evaluations (MEs) as
      its primary oversight tool. MEs assure program integrity by assessing the Special
      Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) State
      agency compliance with Program requirements, evaluating the accomplishment of
      WIC Program objectives, and providing technical assistance to State Agencies
      and supporting efforts to improve and innovate. In FY 2020-2024, FNS' ME target
      area for WIC was Nutrition Services. Delivering high quality nutrition services
