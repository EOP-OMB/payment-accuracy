    pro1: "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) does not have the authority\
      \ to require states participation in a Temporary Assistance for Needy Families\
      \ (TANF) error rate measurement.  Despite limitations, HHS uses a multi-faceted\
      \ approach to improving TANF program integrity and reducing the likelihood of\
      \ improper payments, including performing regular improper payment risk assessments\
      \ (as recently as FY22).  For example, HHS recommended strategies to states\
      \ to minimize initial errors and to identify and correct existing errors. These\
      \ strategies included:\n\n     - training staff to solicit accurate and complete\
      \ information,\n     - using integrated databases from multiple assistance programs,\
      \ and\n     - performing quality control checks.\n\nSince TANF is a state-administered\
      \ program, mitigation strategies and corrective actions to reduce improper payments\
      \ are implemented at the state level.  States have reported using various data\
      \ systems such as the Master Beneficiary Record Database, the Income Eligibility\
      \ Verification System, the Public Assistance Reporting Information System, and\
      \ the National Directory of New Hires to assist in payment integrity efforts."

  2023:
    pro1: "Temporary Assistance for Needy Families is a $16.5 billion block grant\
      \ program that fosters family economic security and stability. Temporary Assistance\
      \ for Needy Families funds a wide range of services that address the program’s\
      \ four broad purposes, which are to:\n \n-Provide assistance to needy families\
      \ so that children can be cared for in their own homes;\n-Reduce the dependency\
      \ of needy parents by promoting job preparation, work and marriage;\n-Prevent\
      \ and reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies; and\n-Encourage the\
      \ formation and maintenance of two-parent families.\n\nTemporary Assistance\
      \ for Needy Families' broad use of funds policy, established under section 401\
      \ of the Social Security Act ensures states have the flexibility to be innovative\
      \ and intentional in designing and administering programs that are intended\
      \ to move families from poverty to self-sufficiency.  The flexibility within\
      \ the Social Security Act allows states to design programming specific to the\
      \ unique needs of the children and families within their state.  HHS remains\
      \ committed to ensuring all funds are used in accordance with the statute, as\
      \ authorized by Congress, however, statutory limitations preclude HHS from collecting\
      \ the required information needed to develop a Temporary Assistance for Needy\
      \ Families improper payment measurement or corrective action plans. \nSection\
      \ 411 of the Social Security Act lists the exact data elements that HHS can\
      \ collect from Temporary Assistance for Needy Families  agencies and therefore\
      \ limits the agency’s ability to measure and oversee payment integrity.  Under\
      \ section 417 of the Social Security Act, HHS cannot collect data elements other\
      \ than those listed.  \n\nDespite these limitations, HHS is committed to ensuring\
      \ all Temporary Assistance for Needy Families funds are expended in accordance\
      \ with federal requirements, and that fiscal and programmatic aspects of administering\
      \ the program are strengthened.  HHS is exploring  strategies to use data reporting\
      \ and technical assistance to monitor and support Temporary Assistance for Needy\
      \ Families agencies in this effort.  For example, HHS  proposed new statutory\
      \ authority, included in the FY 2024 President’s Budget request, that would\
      \ allow Temporary Assistance for Needy Families  to collect information from\
      \ states needed to calculate and report an improper payment estimate, identify\
      \ root causes of improper payments, and develop and monitor corrective actions.\
      \  States also utilize data sources such as the Public Assistance Reporting\
      \ Information System, the National Directory of New Hires, and the Income and\
      \ Eligibility Verification System to reduce improper payments in their programs."
