  pro1: "USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is committed to ensuring integrity\
    \ in the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) to protect taxpayer dollars and safeguard\
    \ the meals that millions of children rely on every summer. \nIn FY19 FNS performed\
    \ a risk assessment of SFSP that resulted in categorizing the program as Phase\
    \ 2, susceptible to improper payments.  During the FY19 SFSP risk assessment,\
    \ program outlays were estimated as $528 million (actual $472 million) requiring\
    \ only 2% of the outlays to be improperly paid to exceed the statutory threshold\
    \ of $10 million. \nSFSP’s Sampling & Estimation Methodology Plan (S&EMP) identified\
    \ FNS’ proposal of a study to measure improper payments, with collection activities\
    \ planned for the summer of 2020. The planned study involved collecting and reviewing\
    \ records from State agencies and sponsoring organizations, along with visits\
    \ to a sample of SFSP sites, to measure certification error, reimbursement rate\
    \ error, meal counting error, and aggregation error. \nHowever, due to the COVID\
    \ public health emergency, the study collection intended for summer of 2020 has\
    \ been delayed until summer of 2023, thereby delaying reporting of an improper\
    \ payment estimation for the current reporting cycle.    Specifically, government\
    \ travel restrictions due to COVID-19 prevented FNS staff from conducting on-site\
    \ data collections.  Moreover, waivers to program operations meant SFSP was not\
    \ operating the program as it normally does, therefore any data collected during\
    \ COVID would not reflect the program operations going forward.\nSpecific details\
    \ of the planned 2023 study include the following: \nFNS’ planned study to measure\
    \ SFSP improper payments (IP), is structured similarly to USDA’s study to measure\
    \ IP in the school meal programs.  The study will require collecting and reviewing\
    \ records from State agencies and sponsoring organizations, along with on-site\
    \ data collection from a sample of the program’s 50,000 sites.  These sites are\
    \ in locations such as parks, schools, and community centers.  On-site data collection\
    \ is very costly.  Therefore, to reduce costs, FNS has designed a study similar\
    \ to the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey to use sponsor-level data for\
    \ establishing improper payments in certification, reimbursement rate, and aggregation.\
    \ FNS will also collect site-level data to assess meal claiming error. This approach\
    \ will not initially produce a nationally representative study that meets PIIA\
    \ requirements, so FNS plans to combine data collected over five years to develop\
    \ its full, IP estimates.  After the fifth year, FNS will maintain a five-year\
    \ moving average error rate and dollar value of program error by replacing the\
    \ oldest year’s data with data collected in the current year."

  pro1: 'The Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) is a USDA Food and Nutrition Service
    (FNS)-funded state administered program that provides free meals and snacks to
    children in low-income areas, or approved by application, when school is not in
    session. At the local level, SFSP is administered by state-approved sponsoring
    organizations. FNS issues program funds to state agencies, which then pass the
    funds to SFSP sponsoring organizations to run the program. Sponsoring organizations
    use that money to cover both the food and administrative costs of the program.
    FNS is currently engaged in an effort to develop an improper payment estimate
    for SFSP in accordance with a Sampling and Estimation Methodology Plan (S&EMP)
    submitted for approval to Office of Management and Budget (OMB). FNS will collect
    data over a 5-year period that began in the summer of 2023. Because FNS has not
    yet determined an improper payment rate for SFSP, the agency is reporting zeroes
    in the survey’s improper payment and outlay fields. During FY23, FNS undertook
    and planned the following activities to mitigate SFSP improper payments: 1) State
    agencies must offer training to sponsors each year prior to the annual sponsor
    application period. The training covers the sponsoring organization’s responsibilities
    and the site supervisor’s responsibilities. Every sponsoring organization must
    send key staff members (including directors) to that State agency training in
    order to be eligible to participate in the program. As a condition of approval
    to participate, and as part of their program agreement with the State agency,
    sponsoring organizations commit to training their site monitors and site personnel.
    2) FNS Regional Offices also completed three Management Evaluations (MEs) per
    region, each of which include a local level review where FNS staff accompany State
    agencies on reviews of local operators. MEs provide a periodic assessment of State
    agency operations and administration; and can result in a report of findings which
    require the state agency to correct any problems. This helps to ensure that State
    agencies are properly monitoring meal claims at the local level; and are working
    with local operators to reduce any improper payments.'
