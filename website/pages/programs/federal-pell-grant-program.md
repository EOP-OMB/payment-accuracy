Actions_By_Year:
  2023:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: To prevent IPs and UPs, FSA will continue to maintain
      a robust internal control framework which includes computer matches performed
      in FSA systems against external sources during the aid delivery process and
      promoting the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (DRT). FSA will also continue to pursue
      long term corrective actions. For example, FSA will continue to work to implement
      the authorities provided in the FUTURE Act to obtain federal tax information
      data directly from the IRS. Obtaining this data will prevent improper payments
      resulting from the applicant misreporting their income on the FAFSA.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app1_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: 'The following examples demonstrate how FSA will continue
      to focus on addressing root causes to reduce improper payments.


      FSA''s most impactful root cause over the last five years has been improper
      payments due to misreported income. To address this root cause, FSA will continue
      to prioritize its corrective action plan to implement the authorities provided
      in the FUTURE Act to obtain federal tax information data directly from the IRS,
      which FSA expects will eliminate misreported income on the FAFSA. FSA will also
      continues to promote the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (DRT), which remains the fastest,
      most accurate way to populate tax return information into the FAFSA form.


      FSA will continue to publish and deliver various free trainings, guidance, and
      resources for school financial aid administrators to target the root causes
      of improper payments at the schools. For example, FSA will publish guidance
      and respond to questions regarding verification requirements to help clarify
      verification requirements and reduce the risk of verification deficiencies.  For
      additional information, see also the agency responses to the various questions
      in this FY 2023 yearend payment integrity data call on the types of corrective
      actions planned (i.e., Automation, Behavioral/Psych Influence, Training, Change
      Process, Cross-Enterprise Sharing, Audit, Predictive Analytics, and Statutory
      Change).


      FSA will continue to maintain a robust internal control framework, which includes
      conducting annual program risk assessments and reviews of program participants,
      among other activities. FSA will continue to leverage Single Audit Act compliance
      audits of its loan and grant programs as a key source of identifying risks and
      potential improper payments made by external entities, including federal, state,
      and private organizations and institutions, that receive and further distribute
      grant and loan funds to subordinate organizations and individuals. FSA will
      continue to work with fund recipients to resolve audit findings timely. FSA
      will work with OMB and the audit community to clarify and strengthen compliance
      audit requirements. All of these actions planned by FSA are specifically focused
      to reduce improper payments and address root causes of improper payments.'

    Description_Action_Taken: 'FSA will continue to perform a variety of general public

      awareness campaigns, training, and other outreach to the community including
      to prospective students and

      parents to help ensure applicants are aware of the importance of completing
      the FAFSA and correctly

      reporting all relevant information. FSA will continue to consider Behavioral/Psych
      Influence in designing

      this outreach.'

      issues. For example, FSA will continue to publish updates to questions and answers
      about verification requirements to help clarify verification requirements and
      reduce the risk of verification deficiencies.


      FSA will also continue to annually host the FSA Training Conference and analyze
      the attendance patterns of institutions and their stakeholders, which will allow
      FSA to understand attendance trends and develop training content accordingly.

  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Through the Student Aid and Borrower Eligibility (SABER)
      Initiative, FSA will continue to implement the Fostering Undergraduate Talent
      by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act and Free Application for Federal
      Student Aid (FAFSA) Simplification Act which ultimately will streamline and
      strengthen the collection of data used to determine eligibility for student
      financial assistance. Implementation of the authorities provided in the FUTURE
      Act will significantly improve data authentication by enabling FSA to automatically
      receive certain federal tax information (FTI) from the IRS through a direct-data
      exchange with applicant approval and enabling customers to automatically report
      their income for the total and permanent disability (TPD) discharge post-monitoring,
      income driven repayment (IDR), and FAFSA processes. Implementation of the authorities
      provided in the FAFSA Simplification Act will improve reporting through, for
      example, modifying the questions that students and their families have to answer
      on the FAFSA form and requiring ED to conduct early awareness and outreach of
      student aid eligibility.

      continue to review and evaluate the effectiveness of schools’ corrective actions
      and mitigation efforts for noted exceptions. When an improper payment is detected
      and deemed collectable, FSA will establish an account receivable and pursue
      collection.

      recover improper payments. In designing controls, the Department attempts to
      strike the right balance between making timely and accurate payments and ensuring
      that controls put in place are not too costly or overly burdensome and thereby
      deter intended beneficiaries from obtaining funds they are entitled to receive.

      \ addressing root causes to reduce improper payments.\n \nFSA's most impactful\
      \ root cause over the last five years for total IP in aggregate for all programs\
      \ has been improper payments due to misreported income. To address this root\
      \ cause, FSA developed a corrective action plan to implement the authorities\
      \ provided in the FUTURE Act to obtain federal tax information data directly\
      \ from the IRS, which is expected to significantly reduce misreported income\
      \ on the FAFSA. In FY 2024, FSA implemented the FAFSA Processing System (FPS)\
      \ and Federal Tax Information (FTI) systems to automatically provide a student\
      \ and families’ federal tax information to FSA for the 2024–25 FAFSA form. In\
      \ FY 2025, FSA will continue to implement the FUTURE Act FAFSA solution for\
      \ students and families with individual taxpayer identification numbers (ITINs)\
      \ during the 2026–27 FAFSA cycle.\n \nFSA has and will continue to publish and\
      \ deliver various free trainings, guidance, and resources for school financial\
      \ aid administrators to target the root causes of improper payments at the schools.\
      \ For example, FSA has and will continue to publish guidance and respond to\
      \ questions regarding verification requirements to help clarify verification\
      \ requirements and reduce the risk of verification deficiencies. For additional\
      \ information, see the section of this report discussing the types of corrective\
      \ actions planned (i.e., Behavioral/Psych Influence, Training, Change Process,\
      \ Cross-Enterprise Sharing, Audit, and Predictive Analytics).\n \nFSA has and\
      \ will continue to maintain a robust internal control framework, which includes\
      \ conducting annual program risk assessments and reviews of program participants,\
      \ among other activities. FSA has and will continue to leverage Single Audit\

      in the FUTURE Act is expected to significantly mitigate the risk of improper

      (SABER) Initiative and implementation of the FAFSA Processing System (FPS) and

      As described in the section of this report discussing types of corrective actions
      taken (i.e., Automation, Behavioral/Psych Influence, Training, Change Process,
      Cross-Enterprise Sharing, Audit, Predictive Analytics, and Statutory Change),
      each corrective action is tailored to one or more specific root causes. For
      example, training and school oversight help correct the various school root
      cause-related improper payments, such as student withdrawal deficiencies, credit
      balance deficiencies, incorrect financial aid determination, and documentation
      deficiencies. FSA measures the effectiveness of each corrective action completed
      annually to ensure that the actions completed help the program achieve or progress
