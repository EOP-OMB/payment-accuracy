    Description_Action_Taken: "Training specifically addresses verification of borrower\
      \ eligibility.  Improper payments stemmed from missing verification of business\
      \ ownership. \n"
    Mitigation_Strategy: app17_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: SBA will continue to provide training to review staff
      on topics and issues related to PPP Forgiveness.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app3_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: The most prevalent cause of improper payments in the
      PPP Forgiveness program was missing verification of business ownership.  Training
      for review staff includes confirming borrower eligibility.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp17_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: Training was provided to SBA review staff on the following
      topics and issues related to PPP Forgiveness.  Reviewers are trained to review
      loan and portfolio data including to confirm  borrower eligibility and confirm,
      the loan amount calculation to ensure the borrower did not apply for a loan
      forgiveness amount in excess of the maximum eligible loan amount. In addition,
      reviewers are trained on the process of confirming that the forgiveness amount
      requested is in accordance with PPP rules, that payroll costs are reasonable,
      ad that non- payroll costs are adequately documented.

  2024:
    pro1: 'The CARES Act established the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans to
      provide economic relief to small businesses and incentivize small businesses
      to keep their workers on the payroll because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The SBA
      separated PPP into three payment integrity reporting categories – PPP Approvals,
      PPP Forgiveness, and PPP Purchases.  PPP ended in May 2021.  Although no new
      PPP funds are being disbursed, borrowers may still request forgiveness for a
      PPP loan and lenders may request guaranty purchase of a PPP loan.  SBA is reporting
      under PIIA on these aspects of the program.

      The PPP loans can be forgiven if the funds are used for payroll costs, interest
      on mortgages, rent, utilities, or other eligible expenses. A borrower can apply
      for forgiveness once all loan proceeds for which the borrower is requesting
      forgiveness have been used. Borrowers can apply for forgiveness any time up
      to up to 5 years from the date that SBA issued the loan number.  If borrowers
      do not apply for forgiveness within 10 months after the last day of the covered
      period, then PPP loan payments are no longer deferred, and borrowers will begin
      making loan payments to their PPP lender.


      PPP loan forgiveness requests were submitted via SBA’s forgiveness platform
      and, although the lenders and borrowers were required to retain supporting documentation,
      they were not required to submit that documentation to the SBA.  In FY2024,
      SBA requested supporting documentation from lenders in order to review to propriety
      of  PPP forgiveness samples.  SBA reviewed samples to determine whether the
      borrower was eligible for an SBA loan under 13 CFR 120.110, and whether the
      borrower met all other regulatory criteria for a PPP loan.

      '
    rnp4: Review standards are established as part of the agency's annual  appraisal
      process.  These standards hold managers accountable  for meeting applicable
      reduction targets, preventing improper payments, and promptly detecting and
      recovering overpayments.

  2024:

    rap5: The agency has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human capital
      and information system and other infrastructure to reduce Improper Payments
      and Unknown Payments.
    rap6: No additional resources for this program were requested.
    rtp4_2: The CARES Act established the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans
      to provide economic relief to small businesses and incentivize small businesses
      to keep their workers on the payroll because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Funding
      for this program ended in 2021, with no new funds advanced. As PPP loans are
      forgiven, outstanding PPP loans will eventually be reduced to a nominal amount.
      Because of this, no tolerable rate has been established.

    cyp20_2: SBA has set a reduction target for PPP Loan Forgiveness at 10.0 percent,
      the statutory limit, for FY2025.  Meeting this reduction target will also bring
      this program into compliance with the Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA).
    rap5: The agency has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human capital
      and information system and other infrastructure to reduce improper payments
      and unknown payments to the reduction target.
    rap6: No additional resources were requested in the most recent budget submission
      of the agency to establish and maintain payment integrity.
    rtp4_2: SBA has not established a tolerable rate for PPP Loan Forgiveness as loans
      under the PPP are no longer being made. With each loan forgiveness payment the
      program gets smaller and smaller.

    cyp8: In response to the FY 2023 PIIA Compliance Audit conducted by OIG, the SBA
      separated PPP into three payment integrity reporting categories – PPP Approvals,
      PPP Forgiveness, and PPP Purchases, and subsequently initiated the improper
      payments review process shortly after. SBA generated the loan sample and requested
      supporting documentation from lenders. In many instances, PPP loans forgiveness
      requests were submitted via SBA’s forgiveness platform and, although the lenders
      and borrowers were required to retain supporting documentation, they were not
      required to submit that documentation to SBA. For several of the PPP loans reviewed
      as part of the forgiveness sample, lenders had to request documents from borrowers.
      SBA asked lenders to submit their documents as soon as possible. As a result
      of the compressed time between documentation requests and reporting improper
      payment rates, many borrowers and lenders were unable to provide complete documentation.
      Those PPP loans with documentation requests outstanding were categorized as
      “Unknown” payments since SBA did not have sufficient supporting documentation
      to make a determination as to whether the forgiveness payment was proper or
      improper.

    cyp8: Unknown payments in FY2024 were  the result of borrowers or lenders which
      did not provide requested documentation. Those PPP loans with documentation
      requests outstanding were categorized as “Unknown” payments since the SBA did
      not have sufficient supporting documentation to make a determination as to whether
      the forgiveness payment was proper or improper.
