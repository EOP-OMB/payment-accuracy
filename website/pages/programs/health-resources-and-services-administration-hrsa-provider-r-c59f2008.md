  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: HHS prioritized the need to gather historical records
      of policy and program decisions already made into accessible locations. HHS
      reprocessed claims incorrectly paid due to federal government error, such as
      internal adjudication or payment errors.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp4_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: Recipients of the UIP are subject to review as set forth

      and Conditions.

  2022:
    pro1: The COVID-19 UIP was determined to be risk-susceptible in FY 2021. Payments
      for testing and treatment claims began in May 2020, and vaccine administration
      began in Feb 2021. HHS developed, submitted, and began to implement the improper
      payment estimation methodology. However, due to the timing constraints of testing
      claims, HHS was unable to complete the statistical sampling methodology and
      subsequent extrapolation procedures to identify and report improper and unknown
      improper payments in FY 2022. HHS expects to complete testing and report an
      improper payment estimate for this program in FY 2023.
    rnp4: null
  2024:
    pro1: The UIP program rounded up in FY 2023. Due to a lack of sufficient funds,
      the UIP stopped accepting testing and treatment claims on March 22, 2022, at11:59
      p.m. ET and on April 5, 2022, at 11:59 p.m. ET for vaccine administration claims.
      On June 3, 2023, the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) of 2023 was enacted. With
      the passage of FRA and the related rescission of program funds, no additional
      claims will be reimbursed under the UIP. Therefore, FY2024will be the last year
      for UIP testing.
    rnp4: HHS has performance management programs to develop goals and strategies
      for staff through which success can be measured and rewarded. Performance Management
      Appraisal Program (PMAP) is one component of the ongoing process of performance
      management. It sets goals for performance and shares those goals while establishing
      the performance plan and required mid-year and annual review discussions. PMAP
      includes two critical elements that track back to the HHS and HRSA strategic
      plan and align with the goals and initiatives of senior leadership. Administrative
      Requirements is one category of critical element that are required of all agency
      staff as part of their job duties and responsibilities to identify and address
      weaknesses to ensure recovery of improper payments and to reduce the number
      of improper payments made by the Department.

      disallowed costs.
    act17_2: HHS is working with the UIP contractor to address any data needs and
      brainstormed methods to address these needs, including any data integrity or
      quality issues. HHS is working with IT and Security partners and the UIP contractor
      to bring UIP data in-house securely to use for various requests, audits, and
      assessments.
    act17_3: HHS continued to work with the UIP contractor to address any data needs
      and brainstormed methods to address these needs, including any data integrity
      or quality issues. HHS is working with IT and security partners and the UIP
      contractor to bring UIP data in-house in a secure manner to use forvarious requests,
      audits, and assessments and reprocessed claims incorrectly paid due to government
      error, such as internal adjudication or payment errors. Prior to the passage
      of the FRA, HHS had planned to reprocess claims that were underpaid as a result
      of the incorrect fee schedule used to pay certain services.
    rnp3: Coupled with the historical records, HHS continues to work with the UIP
      contractor to address any data needs and brainstorm methods to address these
      needs, including any data integrity or quality issues. HHS is working with our
      IT and security partners as well as the UIP contractor, to bring UIP data in-house
      in a secure manner, which can then be used for various requests, audits, and
      assessments and has reprocessed claims that were incorrectly paid due to government
      error, such as internal adjudication or payment errors. Prior to the passage
      of the FRA, HHS had planned to reprocess claims that were underpaid as a result
      of the incorrect fee schedule used to pay certain services.

      (incorrect claims reimbursements due to pricing errors associated with Healthcare
      Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) rates) and incorrect calculation (incorrect
      claims reimbursements due to the use of prior published rates when calculating
      payments or recalculated amounts not reconciling). There is inadequate documentation
      to support some claim payments.

    cyp8: A payment is considered “Unknown” when an agency is unable to obtain the
      documentation needed for a reviewer to determine whether the payment was made
      to the right recipient and/or for the right amount. Concerning FY24 UIP testing,
      HRSA had some “unknown payments” because health-care providers’ eligibility
      could not be verified due to the Tax Identification Number (TINs) per the sample
      data not matching the TINs in the supporting documentation, and HRSA could not
      determine if the payments were made the right health-care providers.
