  rap5: "\"Internal Controls:\nDHA has internal controls in place to support the reduction\
    \ of improper payments in the TRICARE purchased health care program to the levels\
    \ the DHA has targeted.  Effective January 1, 2018, and in fulfillment of section\
    \ 701 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2017, the DHA implemented\
    \ sweeping changes to the TRICARE health benefits structure and MCS contract management\
    \ to synchronize these changes.  As a result, the DHA transitioned its TRICARE-3\
    \ MCSCs (supported by three regional contracts/contractors) to the TRICARE 2017\
    \ contract and regional oversight model (supported by two regional contracts/contractors).\
    \  \nWhile the transition of MCSC contracts from three to two was considered a\
    \ success, the transitioning of claims processing services under one of the two\
    \ T2017 MCSC was met with challenges and control failures.  As a result of a contractor’s\
    \ poor claims processing performance, DHA’s program and contracting offices increased\
    \ oversight and monitoring of the T2017 contractor.  Significant progress was\
    \ made in FY 2020 and FY 2021 by the DHA and the MCSC contractor to resolve this\
    \ deficiency and DHA met its goal of full resolution by the FY 2021 AFR reporting\
    \ cycle.  Moreover, the Contract Resource Management division of DHA received\
    \ an unmodified audit opinion on its financial statements in FY 2020.\n\nHuman\
    \ Capital:\nCurrently, DHA does not have the Human Capital it needs to respond\
    \ to audit findings and recommendations to reduce improper payments in the Military\
    \ Health Benefits program to the level the Agency has targeted. DHA is evaluating\
    \ the possibility of adding two additional FTEs to their payment integrity efforts.\
    \ \nPer a DoDIG recommendation in 2019, Administrative and Other Payment sampling\
    \ and audits are being developed for annual improper payment reporting. These\
    \ audits for PIIA compliance, are in addition to the current Prompt Pay Audits,\
    \ and have demonstrated a need for additional Human Capital. Much work has already\
    \ been done to identify internal control weaknesses and identify and gather additional\
    \ necessary documentation; but, the resources to review payments in their entirety\
    \ are insufficient. DHA is anticipating a risk assessment for USFHP, which accounts\
    \ for nearly 40% of administrative costs, and has identified other administrative\
    \ payments that are suited for risk assessments. For time-intensive manual CAP-DME\
    \ payment reviews, a database was developed to track prior payments to avoid duplicate\
    \ requests for payment in future invoices. This database is in its third phase\
    \ of development and has showed effectiveness in preventing duplicate payments\
    \ going forward. \nIn addition, DHA anticipates the agency will need additional\
    \ skill sets and personnel resources to make determinations on improper payments\
    \ when addressing adjustments in both the universes and in payment errors for\
    \ PIIA reporting.\n\nInformation Systems and Other Infrastructure:\nDHA has the\
    \ information systems and other infrastructure it needs to reduce improper payments\
    \ in the Military Health Benefits program to the levels the Agency has targeted.\
    \  The Agency Private Sector program (managed by the Contract Resource Management\
    \ Division) includes an immense volume of healthcare claims processed by TRICARE\
    \ private sector contractors, into the Agency’s TRICARE Encounter Date (TED) Operational\
    \ Data Store (ODS). To track programs, CRM utilizes 1) the TRICARE Encounter Data\
    \ Set (TEDS), a financial feeder system through which claims are processed to\
    \ Oracle Federal Financials, 2) the E-Commerce System (ECS), an integrated, centralized\
    \ major system that improves the Agency’s core financial, contracting and business\
    \ process by providing seamless integrated financial and contracting systems,\
    \ and 3) the Oracle Federal Financials (OFF), a financial subsystem of the Agency’s\
    \ ECS.  The OFF system supports budget and accounting/financial functions and\
    \ health care (TEDS) claims processing and contains TRICARE Claims Management,\
    \ Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, Purchase Orders and General Ledger modules.\n"
  rnp3: "In FY 2021, the Military Health Benefits program estimated improper and unknown\
    \ payments decreased by $170.90 million, from $338.88 million in FY 2020 to $167.98\
    \ million in FY 2021.  The primary root cause of improper payments in this program\
    \ was attributed to Failure to Access Data/Information category, which accounted\
    \ for $167.98 million. \n\t\n"

    cyp2_1: Overpayments within the Agency’s control are usually the result of failing
      to access supporting data while the claims are being adjudicated.  For example,
      an overpayment could occur if an outdated version of a pricing schedule is utilized.  Refining
      procedures to ensure all of the correct supporting documentation is available
      and accessed at the time the claim is processed would decrease the risk of future
      improper payments.

  pro1: The Department’s Defense Health Agency (DHA) is responsible for the delivery
    of health care services for TRICARE beneficiaries.  DHA remains committed to reducing
    improper payments through improved communication and collaborative efforts with
    stakeholders and providers and through improved performance of the established
    health care contracts. DHA continues to explore opportunities to improve the identification
    of errors, determine specific OMB root causes, and work with other Departments
    and Federal Agencies to resolve situations that may contribute to improper payments.  Additionally,
    DHA aggressively pursued corrective actions that resulted in consistent reduction
    in improper payments in fiscal year 2022.
  rap5: "Internal Controls:\nDefense Health Agency (DHA) has internal controls in\
    \ place to support the reduction of improper payments in the TRICARE purchased\
    \ health care program to the levels the Department has targeted.  DHA’s program\
    \ and contracting offices increased oversight and monitoring of the contracts.\
    \  \n\nHuman Capital:\nDHA performed a comprehensive realignment to ensure that\
    \ sufficient Human Capital aspects are in place in order to support the path forward\
    \ to achieve compliance with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA)\
    \ and to reduce improper payments in the Military Health Benefits program to the\
    \ level the Department has targeted. \n\nInformation Systems and Other Infrastructure:\n\
    DHA has the information systems and other infrastructure it needs to reduce improper\
    \ payments in the Military Health Benefits program to the levels the Department\
    \ has targeted.  The Agency Private Sector program (managed by the Contract Resource\
    \ Management (CRM) Division) includes an immense volume of healthcare claims processed\
    \ by TRICARE private sector contractors into the Agency’s TRICARE Encounter Date\
    \ (TED) Operational Data Store (ODS). To track programs, CRM utilizes: 1) the\
    \ TRICARE Encounter Data Set (TEDS), a financial feeder system through which claims\
    \ are processed to Oracle Federal Financials; 2) the E-Commerce System (ECS),\
    \ an integrated, centralized major system that improves the Agency’s core financial,\

    \ Management, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, Purchase Orders and General\
    \ Ledger modules."
  rap6: The Defense Health Agency did not have any Payment Integrity specific budget
    submissions in FY 2022.
  rnp3: The Department’s Defense Health Agency (DHA) is developing a risk-based sampling
    methodology to directly address the root causes of frequent and high dollar errors.  With
    this added focus on claim characteristics, DHA program offices, payment integrity
    team, Contracting Officers, and their Representatives will be able to devote resources
    where they are most needed to reduce and eliminate Improper Payments and Unknown
    Payments in the future.  Focus studies to test the risk-based sampling methodology
    will begin early in FY2023. Additionally, as part of the corrective action for
    relevant contracts, DHA will specifically address and reduce the frequency of
    these types of error assessments such as High Frequency Error Type, Skilled Nursing
    Facility (SNF) Per-Diem Rate Miscalculated, Reimbursement Method Miscalculated,
    and Documentation to Support Payments made by Other Health Insurance.
  rtp1: Unknown
  rtp4_2: "The Department cannot establish an effective tolerable rate until the Department\
    \ can produce reliable Payment Integrity estimates for the programs that are currently\
    \ in Phase II. The DoD Office of Inspector General (OIG) concluded that the previous\
    \ Department estimates were unreliable and were caused primarily by using an inappropriate\
    \ variable, which led to insufficient sample sizes to pull the Payment Integrity\
    \ sample population for testing. \n\nThe Department has since implemented several\
    \ DoD OIG recommendations such as addressing the Defense Health Agency administrative\
    \ payments recommendation to consider data characteristics. This led to the creation\
    \ of a separate OMB Payment Integrity program that is currently performing a comprehensive\
    \ risk assessment. Additionally, in FY 2023 the Department will restructure the\
    \ Military Health Benefits (MHB) program to align to the specific individual contract\
    \ performance requirements and characteristics. This strategic realignment of\
    \ the MHB program, based on the six different existing contracts that comprise\
    \ the current program, will provide several additional benefits for the Department."
