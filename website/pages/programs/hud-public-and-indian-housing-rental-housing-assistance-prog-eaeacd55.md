  pro1: 'Based on guidance from OMB on 10/25/2022, HUD did not report improper payment
    estimates for rental assistance programs TBRA and PBRA as the full payment lifecycle
    could not be verified and testing was unable to be completed. HUD was unable to
    produce estimates due to limitations in obtaining supporting documentation needed
    for testing in a timely manner for FY 2022 disbursements. Without estimates, HUD
    could not determine whether its improper payment plus unknown payment estimate
    was below or above the statutory threshold. As a result, HUD could not implement
    corrective actions and other OMB requirements for programs above the statutory
    threshold. HUD did not perform testing of the full payment cycle for RHAP - TBRA
    and PBRA related to FY 2022 payments due to lack of compliance readiness, including:
    need of further training of personnel at all levels of the payment cycle, resource
    limitations, key person dependencies, and the delay of full implementation of
    corrective actions around privacy and security concerns. Due to this scope limitation,
    HUD is not reporting an error rate for PBRA and TBRA for the FY 2023 reporting
    cycle. Target date is FY2027, dependent on funding.'

  rac3: 'During FY 2024, HUD assessed existing technology solutions and planned improvements
    to establish effective controls within the Tenant Based Rental Assistance (TBRA)
    program. The goal is to prevent and detect improper payments, as outlined in the
    Public and Indian Housing IT modernization plan. Currently, HUD’s Office of Public
    and Indian Housing (PIH) Office of Field Operations (OFO) uses the Compliance
    Monitoring Review (CMR) tool and the Enterprise Income Verification (EIV) system
    to verify and validate information, such as accurate payment standards, income
    eligibility, eligibility determination, in PHA tenant files for accuracy.  Public
    housing agenciey’s (PHAs) subject to reviews are selected at random and performed
    both on site and in the virtual environment.  HUD evaluated existing reports for
    estimating improper payment rates but found they did not meet the stringent requirements
    set by the Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA). Additionally, these reports
    could not generate reliable error estimates with sufficient precision to cover
    the entire payment life cycle, which includes payments from HUD to PHAs), from
    PHAs to landlords, and considerations for eligibility verification.


    Looking ahead to FY 2025 and beyond, and as funding is available, HUD will continue
    implementing the Public and Indian Housing IT modernization plan and will explore
    testing methods for sub-populations within the TBRA portfolio. By exploring other
    approaches for testing, such as subdividing the TBRA PHA populations, HUD will
    be able to support some level of testing along with modernization efforts and
    tailor the testing approach. HUD’s modernization plans will benefit from efforts
    to test the full payment life cycle for both payee and eligibility tiers through
    the following initiatives:


    •The Enterprise Voucher Management System (eVMS) is set to significantly improve
    the administration of the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program. It will modernize
    how HUD records monthly HCV performance and automate cash management transactions
    as well as financial reporting. eVMS will enhance the accuracy and timeliness
    of housing assistance payments (HAPs), thereby reducing prepaid expenses and accounts
    payables. This will be achieved by using real-time family-level data that PHAs
    submit to HUD via the HUD-50058 through IMS PIC. The system will also perform
    month-to-month reconciliations for retroactive adjustments due to annual income
    certifications or changes in family composition. Moreover, eVMS will calculate
    and track administrative fees across all voucher programs, simplifying decision-making
    for PHAs regarding voucher issuance and other program needs by providing daily
    online views of PHA funding balances. Overall, eVMS will automate cash management
    payments and reconciliations, streamline reporting for HUD’s financials, and generate
    data to test elements within payee and eligibility tiers.


    •HUD is also advancing one key project, a beta version of the Enhanced EIV tool,
    which uses business intelligence and predictive analytics to identify income trends
    and changes. The system improvements will strengthen preventative controls at
    the time of initial applications and renewals, with a focus on eligibility. The
    Enhanced EIV tool will help identify income discrepancies during tenant applications
    and renewals, providing PHAs with immediate access to income data reported by
    other partners. This proactive approach aims to reduce the risk of improper payments
    resulting from income discrepancies. By leveraging both current and historical
    data alongside predictive analytics, HUD will be able to pinpoint trends and forecasts
    concerning family income. The enhancements will eventually expand to involve multiple
    stakeholders, including all housing authorities. The Enhanced EIV tool will offer
    a comprehensive view across the department for all PHAs, ensuring that accurate
    tenant-level information is used for determining Voucher Housing Assistance Payments
    (HAP) eligibility. This holistic perspective will aid in identifying discrepancies
    between tenant-reported income and data from other partners and federal agencies,
    such as the National Database of New Hires from the Department of Health and Human
    Services (HHS).


    These initiatives reflect HUD''s commitment to enhancing the integrity and efficiency
    of the TBRA program, ultimately benefiting the communities we serve and demonstrating
    a strong commitment to payment integrity.
