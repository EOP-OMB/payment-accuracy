Actions_By_Year:
  2023:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: The primary root cause for the program's improper payments
      is the timing when transit operating expenses became eligible for reimbursement.
      The COVID relief funds provided existing programs with new eligibilities, including
      transit operating funding in areas formerly only permitted for capital expenses.
      Per statute, only costs incurred for the period beginning January 20, 2020 may
      be reimbursed under the expanded eligibilities. Training and increased awareness
      will inform grant recipient that their processes and procedures need to accommodate
      the statutory requirements of COVID relief funding.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app17_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: FTA will advise grant recipients of requirements to
      correct future reimbursement requests and recover overpayments, if applicable.
      FTA will also issue a nationwide memorandum to its COVID funding recipients
      to clarify that cost incurred prior to COVID-19 are ineligible.

    rnp4: "DOT’s Deputy Chief Financial Officer (DCFO) is the senior accountable official\
      \ responsible for completion of the improper payments related remediation plans.\
      \ The DCFO’s performance plan contains accountability mechanisms, which include\
      \ closure of corrective actions associated with improper payment remediation\
      \ plans.\n\nAt the agency-level, FTA’s Chief Financial Officer oversees FTA’s\
      \ Office of Budget and Policy which administers the implementation of the Administration’s\
      \ PIIA requirements. This office develops improper payment reduction targets,\
      \ implements corrective actions, and coordinates the recapture of improper payments\
      \ identified during PIIA reviews. The Office of Budget and Policy works with\
      \ FTA oversight and regional offices to hold recipients accountable on the closure\
      \ of corrective actions associated with improper payment remediation plans.\n\
      \nFor FTA, the grant development stage, before award and obligation of Federal\
      \ funds, is critical to program and payment integrity. During this stage, FTA\
      \ personnel verify that only eligible and allowable activities are included\
      \ in the grant. After grant award and obligation of FTA funds, the recipient\
      \ certifies compliance with applicable Federal requirements annually, compliance\
      \ with requirements is confirmed via FTA’s oversight processes, and FTA regional\
      \ offices track and monitor deficiencies to ensure the recipient implements\
      \ corrective action. \n\nFTA manages several oversight programs covering transit\
      \ safety, its many grant programs, more than 1,000 grantees, and thousands of\
      \ projects, including major capital projects over $1 billion, as well as mid-size\
      \ and smaller projects. FTA’s Office of Program Oversight develops and implements\
      \ a comprehensive national oversight program to ensure that funding recipients\
      \ remain compliant with the requirements of assistance programs. To foster stewardship\
      \ of federal funds, the office institutes oversight performance metrics, analyzes\
      \ nationwide recipient compliance trends, and develops and implements technical\
      \ assistance and training tools and events based on grantee oversight trend\
      \ analysis. Types of oversight reviews include: Triennial Reviews (mandated\
      \ compliance reviews); State Management Reviews; Procurement System Reviews;\
      \ and Financial Management Oversight Reviews.\n"

    act17_2: The program consists of three emergency appropriations that provided

      than capital investments. Spending from the COVID relief funds peaked in FY
      2022 and outlays are projected to decrease in subsequent fiscal years. As these
      funds are exhausted, the risk of improper payments will be reduced commensurate
      with the level of remaining funding.
    act17_3: In implementing and prioritizing the corrective actions, FTA considered
      the observations and remediation recommendations from FY 2023 testing and projected
      decrease of COVID-funded outlays. FTA placed emphasis ongoing training to strengthen
      controls and staff knowledge at the regional offices and recipient levels to
      improve project documentation and/or payment processes.
