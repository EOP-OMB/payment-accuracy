    rnp3: The Department only in late October 2021 received the final management report
      for the results of the statistical sampling and estimation performed for FY
      2020 disbursements (Current Year) for funds received by EDA under the Bipartisan
      Budget Act of 2018.  The Department will review and consider the results of
      the statistical sampling with regard to the IPs estimation (no UPs were identified),
      and will appropriately consider/determine appropriate action(s).

    rnp3: Not applicable as there is no need for a corrective action plan for this
      program since the IP rate is below the statutory threshold.

    cyp20_2: OMB is requiring that we provide a reduction target within the data collection
      tool even though we are not required to provide one per Appendix C of OMB Circular
      A-123 since the IP and UP estimate for this program is not above the statutory
      threshold. Since we are forced to respond to this question in the tool, we are
      entering in the current year IP rate of 5.6%, but the Department does not expect
      to be held to this figure.
    rap5: The program is still trying to identify the tolerable rate.
    rap6: Not applicable. The program is still trying to identify the tolerable rate.
    rtp4_2: The Department has not yet determined a tolerable rate as it just received
      the statistical sampling results for this reporting period in late October.
      In prior years, the IP rate was not significant and the Department did not find
      it necessary to determine a tolerable rate previously.

    cyp2_1: "The overpayments were within the agency's control because the overpayments\
      \ were either caused by: \n\n1) failure by the Regional Office to verify that\
      \ the amount requested for reimbursement by the Recipient was correct prior\
      \ to disbursing funds. The grant rate used by the Recipient to calculate the\
      \ amount did not agree to the cost share proportions of the Award; \n\n2) failure\
      \ by the Regional Office to verify that the amount requested for reimbursement\
      \ by the Recipient was correct prior to making the disbursement. The Recipient\
      \ incorrectly calculated the amount, using the rounded instead of actual grant\
      \ rate to determine Federal share; or\n\n3) an administrative error made by\
      \ the Regional Office when processing the Recipient's Request for Reimbursement.\
