    pro1: "Due to the expanse and extent of damage tied to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma,\
      \ and Maria, many USCG facilities, assets, systems, and equipment suffered damage.\
      \ Disaster Supplemental Funding received addresses recovery and reconstitution\
      \ costs due to damage incurred by numerous coastal response and security stations,\
      \ particularly along the Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, and Texas\
      \ coasts as well as throughout Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\n\
      For the testing conducted in 2021, USCG’s assessment was focused on the associated\
      \ FY 2019 disaster supplemental funding disbursements of over $42 million applicable\
      \ for review under PIIA. For additional information on the results of this assessment,\
      \ please refer to the FY 2021 published data on paymentaccuracy.gov. \n\nA second\
      \ year of consecutive testing has been conducted for the United States Coast\
      \ Guard (USCG) - Procurements, Construction, and Improvement - Disaster Supplemental\
      \ Funds program with results remaining below the OMB Circular A-123, Appendix\
      \ C guidance threshold to be considered susceptible to significant improper\
      \ payments. DHS has determined that the program has been baselined and has converted\
      \ the program back to Phase 1 for FY 2023 reporting based on the quantitative\
      \ results of the testing."

    rnp3: N/A - As the United States Coast Guard (USCG) – Procurements, Construction,
      and Improvement – Disaster Supplemental Funds program has identified and reported
      an estimated improper and consolidated unknown payments rate of below 1.50%,
      in accordance with OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C, the program is not susceptible
      to significant improper payments and thus has not established a corrective action
      plan.

    rap5: Program is reflective of disaster supplemental funding that was received
      by DHS to respond to the Hurricane Harvey, Irma, and Maria disasters that occurred
      in the 2017 / 2018 timeframe. Due to the burden of testing and reporting, Disaster
      Supplemental Funding programs are tested and reported two years in arrears.
      As such, by the time that remedial action is taken and/or is realized in the
      PIIA testing results, the total value of annual disbursements is expected to
      be below the threshold for PIIA action. DHS will continue to make process and
      internal control improvements to improve the payment management processes as
      it relates to supplemental funding but feels that internal control, human capital,
      information system, and infrastructure needs have been met.

    cyp20_2: "For statistical testing performed over the FY 2019 and FY 2020 disbursements\
      \ made by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) – PC&I – Disaster Supplemental\
      \ Funds program, minimal improper payments have been identified. As such, DHS\
      \ has published the reduction target at the same 0.58%. \n\nHowever, based on\
      \ the two consecutive years of testing results and the fact that DHS considers\
      \ the program baselined, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) – PCI – Disaster\
      \ Supplemental Funds program will be converted back to Phase 1, in accordance\
      \ with OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C guidance, for the FY 2023 reporting."
    rap5: DHS has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human capital
      and information system and other infrastructure to reduce improper payments
      and unknown payments to the tolerable rate for the United States Coast Guard
      (USCG) – Procurements, Construction, and Improvement – Disaster Supplemental
      Funds program.
    rap6: "N/A - DHS did not request additional resources in the most recent budget\
      \ submission of the agency. \n\nBased on the historical testing results that\
      \ have been published, the internal controls and resources within the United\
      \ States Coast Guard (USCG) – Procurements, Construction, and Improvement –\
      \ Disaster Supplemental Funds program have been and remain sufficient to reduce\
      \ and prevent improper payments and unknown payments to a tolerable level."

    cyp2_1: Due to the nature of a Procurements, Construction, and Improvement (PC&I)
      based program, DHS believes that all payments disbursed by the United States
      Coast Guard (USCG) - Procurements, Construction, and Improvement - Disaster
      Supplemental Funds program are within the agency's control. Therefore, all resulting
      improper payments, to include overpayments, have also been determined to be
      within the control of the agency.
