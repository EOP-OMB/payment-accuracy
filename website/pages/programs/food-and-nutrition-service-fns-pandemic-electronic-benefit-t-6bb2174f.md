    rnp3: USDA FNS and the states spend considerable time each year discussing P-EBT
      program requirements and reviewing the latest updates to the agency’s guidance.
      The same state agencies that administer P-EBT also administer Supplemental Nutrition
      Assistance Program (SNAP) and the states’ school lunch and breakfast programs.
      The time spent on P-EBT training takes time away from these other programs.
      In short, training is costly and USDA believes that the considerable federal
      and state investment already devoted to P-EBT training is adequate given the
      program’s relatively low error rate.
