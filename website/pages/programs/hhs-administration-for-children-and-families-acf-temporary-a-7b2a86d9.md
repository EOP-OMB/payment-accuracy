  pro1: "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) does not have the authority\
    \ to require states participation in a Temporary Assistance for Needy Families\
    \ (TANF) error rate measurement.  Despite limitations, HHS uses a multi-faceted\
    \ approach to improving TANF program integrity and reducing the likelihood of\
    \ improper payments, including performing regular improper payment risk assessments\
    \ (as recently as FY22).  For example, HHS recommended strategies to states to\
    \ minimize initial errors and to identify and correct existing errors. These strategies\
    \ included:\n\n     - training staff to solicit accurate and complete information,\n\
    \     - using integrated databases from multiple assistance programs, and\n  \
    \   - performing quality control checks.\n\nSince TANF is a state-administered\
    \ program, mitigation strategies and corrective actions to reduce improper payments\
    \ are implemented at the state level.  States have reported using various data\
    \ systems such as the Master Beneficiary Record Database, the Income Eligibility\
    \ Verification System, the Public Assistance Reporting Information System, and\
    \ the National Directory of New Hires to assist in payment integrity efforts."

  pro1: "Temporary Assistance for Needy Families is a $16.5 billion block grant program\
    \ that fosters family economic security and stability. Temporary Assistance for\
    \ Needy Families funds a wide range of services that address the program’s four\
    \ broad purposes, which are to:\n \n-Provide assistance to needy families so that\
    \ children can be cared for in their own homes;\n-Reduce the dependency of needy\
    \ parents by promoting job preparation, work and marriage;\n-Prevent and reduce\
    \ the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies; and\n-Encourage the formation and\
    \ maintenance of two-parent families.\n\nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families'\
    \ broad use of funds policy, established under section 401 of the Social Security\
    \ Act ensures states have the flexibility to be innovative and intentional in\
    \ designing and administering programs that are intended to move families from\
    \ poverty to self-sufficiency.  The flexibility within the Social Security Act\
    \ allows states to design programming specific to the unique needs of the children\
    \ and families within their state.  HHS remains committed to ensuring all funds\
    \ are used in accordance with the statute, as authorized by Congress, however,\
    \ statutory limitations preclude HHS from collecting the required information\
    \ needed to develop a Temporary Assistance for Needy Families improper payment\
    \ measurement or corrective action plans. \nSection 411 of the Social Security\
    \ Act lists the exact data elements that HHS can collect from Temporary Assistance\
    \ for Needy Families  agencies and therefore limits the agency’s ability to measure\
    \ and oversee payment integrity.  Under section 417 of the Social Security Act,\
    \ HHS cannot collect data elements other than those listed.  \n\nDespite these\
    \ limitations, HHS is committed to ensuring all Temporary Assistance for Needy\
    \ Families funds are expended in accordance with federal requirements, and that\
    \ fiscal and programmatic aspects of administering the program are strengthened.\
    \  HHS is exploring  strategies to use data reporting and technical assistance\
    \ to monitor and support Temporary Assistance for Needy Families agencies in this\
    \ effort.  For example, HHS  proposed new statutory authority, included in the\
    \ FY 2024 President’s Budget request, that would allow Temporary Assistance for\
    \ Needy Families  to collect information from states needed to calculate and report\
    \ an improper payment estimate, identify root causes of improper payments, and\
    \ develop and monitor corrective actions.  States also utilize data sources such\
    \ as the Public Assistance Reporting Information System, the National Directory\
    \ of New Hires, and the Income and Eligibility Verification System to reduce improper\
    \ payments in their programs."

  rac3: 'The HHS Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program is in Phase 2 but
    is not reporting an improper payment and unknown payment estimate for the current
    reporting year.  Statutory limitations preclude HHS from collecting the required
    information needed to develop a Temporary Assistance for Needy Families improper
    payment measurement or corrective action plans.  Specifically, section 411 of
    the Social Security Act lists the exact data elements that HHS can collect from
    Temporary Assistance for Needy Families agencies.  Data on case and payment accuracy
    is not included under this section.  Further, Section 417 of the Social Security
    Act, provides that HHS may only regulate the conduct of states where Congress
    has given ACF the express authority.  Until the current statutory language is
    amended to permit the development and administration of a national error rate,
    HHS is unable to provide the fiscal year that the program is expected to be able
    to report an estimate.
