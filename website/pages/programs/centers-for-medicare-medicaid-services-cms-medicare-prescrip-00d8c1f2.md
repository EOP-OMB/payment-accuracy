  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: In June 2024, HHS held a Part C and Part D Fraud, Waste,
      and Abuse training that covered information about current MAO and PDP fraud
      schemes, fraud prevention techniques, and activities that are critical to the
      efforts to deter and combat fraud, waste, and abuse.  In September 2024, HHS
      also held an Opioid mission with 4 plan sponsors. This mission covered Opioid
      best practices and current fraud schemes. HHS maintained formal outreach to
      plan sponsors for incomplete or invalid documentation to address potential improper
      payments during the sample submission period. Furthermore, HHS sent Final Findings
      Reports to all Part D sponsors participating in the improper payment measurement,

      scopes but share the goal of reducing and recovering improper Part D payments.
      In FY 2024, the I-MEDIC continued to launch investigations, made recommendations
      for provider revocations, sent referrals to law enforcement, and submitted referrals
      to other entities like state pharmacy and medical boards, Medicare Quality Improvement
      Organizations, and other Medicare contractors. HHS also audits Part D plan sponsors
      to reduce improper payments and detect non-compliance with program integrity
      requirements.  In FY 2024, HHS conducted four Program Integrity Audits, aiming
      to educate plan sponsors about fraud, waste, and abuse issues.

    pro1: 'In Reporting Year (RY) 2023, CMS implemented methodology refinements and
      technical changes that contributed to an increase in the RY 2023 improper payment
      rate estimation. Due to the methodology changes introduced in RY 2023, the rates
      for RY 2022 and RY 2023 are not comparable. A baseline for improper payments
      in Medicare Part D has not yet been established, as the RY 2023 estimate reflects
      numerous methodology changes.


      CMS is committed to strengthening and maintaining program integrity efforts
      to reduce improper payments rates. CMS'' key corrective actions include conducting
      outreach to plan sponsors, conducting both Part D and Program Integrity audits,
      and conducting comprehensive opioid education missions.

      (RY) 2024 Medicare Part D improper payment rate is statistically similar to
      the RY 2023 Medicare Part D improper payment rate.
    rnp4: HHS reports the agency’s improper payment targets annually in the AFR. In
      addition, HHS sets annual Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) goals
      tied to reducing the improper payments. HHS managers are held accountable for
      assessing improper payment rates and taking meaningful steps to address the
      root causes of error. These efforts are reflected in each manager’s performance
      plan, as appropriate. HHS also reports quarterly on the specific actions taken
      to address the improper payment rates through the quarterly scorecard process
      for high-priority programs, providing a level of public oversight over these
      efforts.

      performance plan contains strategic goals that are related to strengthening

    rnp3: HHS will continue to prioritize and implement effective corrective actions
      and mitigation strategies that reduce improper payments and unknown payments
      agency-wide as evidenced by its lower error rate of 3.72%.  The actions taken
      and planned to address failure to access data are proportional to the improper
      payment rate and address the root causes of the improper payments. For example,
      HHS audits Part D plan sponsors to address high-risk drugs and educate sponsors
      on fraud, waste, and abuse. These audits have varying scopes but share the goal
      of reducing and recovering improper Part D payments. Future audits may account
      for areas in which missing or invalid documentation has been found to be a persistent
      issue. HHS also uses education and outreach as a key tool to reduce improper
      payments. Annually, the agency identifies the root causes of improper payments
      and develops specific corrective actions to address them. This work is reported
      on through the AFR process.
  2024:
    act17_1: Part D overpayments mainly consist of errors resulting from drug or drug
      coverage or insufficient documentation. As such, CMS focused on educating Part
      D plan sponsors on issues of fraud, waste, and abuse to cut down on confusion
      regarding documentation requirements and coverage requirements under Part D.
    act17_2: In FY 2025, HHS will continue Part D plan sponsor audits, outreach, and
      training to reduce overpayments. Audits and training will be focused on high-risk
      drugs (i.e., at high risk of overpayments and/or beneficiary harm) and other
      areas of risk to the program. HHS' activities will align with the drivers and
      root causes of the error rate.
    act17_3: In FY 2024, HHS audited Part D plan sponsors to address high-risk drugs
      and educate sponsors on fraud, waste, and abuse. HHS also conducted trainings,
      such as Opioid Education Mission webinars. The improper payment rate for FY
      2024 is 3.70%, which supports the effective implementation and prioritization
      of action within the agency. Collectively, future improper payment rate results
      will inform whether the overall corrective action plan was effective and provide
      insight into which components of the plan may need to be modified or refined
      to improve effectiveness.
