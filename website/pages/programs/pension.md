Actions_By_Year:
  2023:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions planned regarding automation include conducting
      quarterly matches with the Social Security Administration to identify variances
      between Social Security Administration income a beneficiary is receiving versus
      the amounts reported by a beneficiary to VA. Differences indicate potential
      overpayments, so correcting the differences ensures VA is making correct payments
      and prevents future improper payments. In FY 2023, errors are largely attributable
      to failure to access data/information prior to issuing payment. To address the
      root cause, VA will use the existing match between Social Security Administration
      income data and VA income data for pension beneficiaries. This enables VA to
      identify variances which are indicators of potential overpayments. Claims with
      variances are prioritized and sent to claims processors in batches to resolve
      discrepancies, identify and establish debts for overpayments if applicable,
      and prevent future overpayments. In addition, VA uses the Social Security Administrations
      Death Master File to match against active beneficiaries and their dependents,
      which allows VA to stop payment timely for deceased beneficiaries. These ongoing
      Social Security Administration matches identify potentially deceased beneficiaries
      still receiving benefits for VA to stop benefits and prevent overpayments. These
      actions are designed to reduce improper payment errors associated with failure
      to access data/information needed to ensure proper payment amounts. Automation
      was the best mitigation strategy in order to improve accuracy and accessibility
      of data to validate beneficiary income and eligibility status prior to payment.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app1_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: VA has identified root causes of improper payments and
      developed effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies. The causes
      of overpayments and underpayments were attributed to failure to access data/information,
      inability to access data/information and data/information does not exist. In
      particular, the majority of overpayments occurred due to beneficiaries not timely
      reporting changes in Social Security income to VA. The underpayments were due
      to beneficiaries who are the sole source for medical expenses providing documentation
      after payments were made. Regulations allow beneficiaries to provide revised
      medical expenses to VA after payments are made and regulations require VA to
      make applicable retroactive adjustments to benefit payments. Automation was
      the best mitigation strategy because overpayments resulted from beneficiaries
      not timely providing information to VA, so VA identified the Social Security
      Administration as an alternative data source and implemented a quarterly Social
      Security income match. This match enables VA to identify variances between Social
      Security Administration income a beneficiary is receiving versus the amounts
      reported by a beneficiary to VA. Differences indicate potential overpayments,
      so correcting the differences ensures VA is making correct payments and prevents
      future improper payments. The Social Security income match occurs quarterly
      and regulations require a due-process period before VA adjusts a beneficiary's
      pension payment, so correcting applicable payments requires a period of time.
      Audit was the best mitigation strategy in order to identify medical expense
      discrepancies and reinforce adherence to policies and procedures to make accurate
      decisions prior to payment.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app17_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions planned regarding audit include randomly reviewing
      claim processors’ work to ensure policies and procedures are properly applied
      in making accurate pension rate decisions to prevent future improper payments.
      In FY 2023, errors are largely attributable to failure to access data/information
      prior to issuing payment. Due to administrative errors, corrective action includes
      conducting Special Focus Reviews to ensure claims processors apply proper policies
      and procedures in making accurate decisions. Additional audit actions include
      taking corrective actions when improper payments are identified such as proper
      adjudication of claims or collection of overpayments if applicable. These actions
      are designed to reduce improper payment errors associated with failure to access
      data/information needed to ensure proper payment amounts. Audit was the best
      mitigation strategy in order to identify discrepancies and reinforce adherence
      to policies and procedures to make accurate decisions prior to payment.

  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions planned include training staff to ensure policies
      and procedures are properly applied in making accurate pension rate decisions
      to prevent future improper payments. To address the root cause, training will
      focus on human errors identified during FY 2024 payment integrity testing. These
      actions are designed to reduce future improper payment errors associated with
      failure to access data/information needed to ensure proper payment amounts and
      unknown payments attributed to being unable to determine whether proper or improper.
      Training was the best mitigation strategy in order to improve awareness and
      increase skills to improve accurate pension rate decisions prior to payment.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app3_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions planned include conducting quarterly matches
      with the Social Security Administration to identify variances between Social
      Security Administration income a beneficiary is receiving versus the amounts
      reported by a beneficiary to VA. Differences indicate potential changes in a
      beneficiary’s income, which could require a change to their pension benefit.
      Validating whether a change is needed and making changes if necessary, prevents
      future improper payments. To address the root cause, VA will use the existing
      match between Social Security Administration income data and VA income data
      for pension beneficiaries. This enables VA to identify variances which are indicators
      of potential overpayments. Claims with variances are prioritized and sent to

Additional_Information_By_Year:
  2021:
    pro1: null
    rnp4: null
  2022:
    pro1: The Pension program continues to prioritize and implement effective corrective
      actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper and unknown payments.  Although
      the Pension program experienced an overall increase in improper payments from
      FY 2021 to FY 2022, the program made significant headway in implementing a mitigation
      strategy process designed to decrease improper payments in the highest overall
      error category, failure to access data/information. Starting in September 2022,
      a large batch of claims is sent weekly to claims processors for review and corrective
      action. Given the time it takes to implement corrective actions and mitigation
      strategies, the program expects the impact of this action on FY 2023 payments
      with anticipated compliance with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019
      for FY 2024.
    rnp4: null
  2023:
    pro1: The Pension program continues to prioritize and implement effective corrective
      actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper payments. Although VA
      pension remains non-compliant, the impact of the program changes is reflected
      in a decrease in the improper and unknown payment rate from 11.66% in FY 2022
      to 10.86% (for a 0.80% reduction) and a $73.16 million decrease in improper
      payments in FY 2023. Given the time it takes to implement corrective actions
      and mitigation strategies, the program expects the continued positive impact
      of these actions on its FY 2024 improper and unknown payment rate.
    rnp4: null
  2024:
    pro1: The Pension program continues to prioritize and implement corrective actions
      and mitigation strategies that reduce improper and unknown payments. Although
      the Pension program remains noncompliant and reported an increase in overall
      improper and unknown payments, the program underwent improvements in FY 2024
      that will improve its ability to reduce improper payments in the future. This
      included updating testing procedures to correctly differentiate monetary loss
      from unknown payments, increasing detail obtained during testing to improve
      development of effective corrective actions, and improving corrective action
      and mitigation strategies planned for FY 2025.
    rnp4: 'The Pension program was determined noncompliant with PIIA for FY 2023 by
      the OIG in May 2024. Additionally, the program is reporting improper and unknown
      payments above the required thresholds in FY 2024 for a compliance determination
      by the OIG in May 2025. In FY 2025, the Executive Director for Pension and Fiduciary
      Service will be focused on prevention and recovery of overpayments as appropriate.
      This will include various mitigation strategies such as audit, automation, and
      training. These actions will help bring the program into compliance by reducing
      errors associated with failure to access data/information and unknown payments
      attributed to being unable to determine whether proper or improper. The Executive
      Director for Pension and Fiduciary Service’s performance plan includes performance
      metrics appropriate to ensure mission is met while still ensuring payment integrity.


      Generally, VA Senior Executives are held accountable via the performance appraisal
      process as established by VA’s Corporate Senior Executive Management Office.
      This process includes oversight from VA’s Performance Review Board, which evaluates
      each executive’s performance appraisal, the executive’s response to the initial
      summary rating, if any, and the results of any higher-level official’s findings
      and recommendations. Performance bonuses and/or salary increases are aligned
      with each Senior Executive’s overall level of performance.'

    act17_3: null
    rnp3: VA continues to prioritize and implement effective corrective actions and
      mitigation strategies that reduce improper payments agency-wide as evidenced
      by its third consecutive and largest year of reductions. Due to Pension reporting
      over $100 million of overpayments/loss in FY2020, the program was required by
      Office of Management and Budget to report quarterly on activities and accomplishments
      that reduce monetary loss. Those activities and accomplishments can be found
      at PaymentAccuracy.gov. Pension has remained committed to actions that reduce
      monetary loss and continues to tailor corrective actions to reduce improper
      payments.
  2022:

    act17_3: null
    rnp3: 'VA performed an effectiveness review in FY 2022 of the corrective action
      plans implemented in FY 2021.  The purpose of this review was to assess the
      appropriateness of corrective actions and mitigation strategies and whether
      the actions were effectively implemented and prioritized within the agency.  The
      results of the Pension program indicated that of the seven actions assessed,
      four were closed and determined to be effective in mitigating the root cause,
      one was open and determined to be ineffective in mitigating the root cause,
      and two were designed ineffectively to mitigate the root cause.


      For errors tied to failure to access data/information and inability to access
      data/information, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies contributed
      to a total reduction in improper payment amount from $410.52m in FY 2020 to
      $378.87m in FY 2021, or a 7% reduction. For errors tied to unable to determine
      whether proper or improper, associated corrective actions contributed to a total
      reduction in the unknown payment amount from $4.64m in FY 2020 to $2.63m in
      FY 2021, or a 43% reduction.


      VA will perform an effectiveness review in FY 2023 of the corrective action
      plans implemented in FY 2022 due to the time needed to implement actions as
      well as to impact the payment process. Results of this review will be reported
      in FY 2023.'

    act17_3: null
    rnp3: The Pension program continues to prioritize and implement effective corrective
      actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper payments. In FY 2023,
      VA performed an effectiveness review of actions developed and implemented in
      FY 2022. The purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness of corrective
      actions or mitigation strategies and whether the actions were effectively implemented
      and prioritized within the agency. The results for the Pension program indicated
      that of the four actions assessed, one was closed and determined to be effective
      in mitigating the root cause, one was open and determined to be correctly designed
      to mitigate the root cause, and two were open and determined that improvements
      could be made to effectively mitigate the root cause. If improvements could
      be made, VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine the program's mitigation
      strategies to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s) of error. For errors
      tied to failure to access data/information, associated corrective actions or
      mitigation strategies contributed to a reduction in the improper payment amount
      from $472.99 million in FY 2022 to $362.34 million in FY 2023, or a 23% reduction.
      VA will perform an effectiveness review in FY 2024 of the corrective action
      plans developed and implemented in FY 2023 due to the time needed to develop
      and implement actions as well as to impact the payment process. Results of this
      review will be reported in FY 2024.
  2024:
    act17_1: 'VA has identified root causes of improper and unknown payments and developed
      corrective actions and mitigation strategies. The causes of FY 2024 overpayments
      and underpayments were attributed to failure to access data/information, and
      the cause of unknown payments was attributed to unable to determine whether
      proper or improper. In particular, the majority of overpayments occurred due
      to beneficiaries not timely reporting changes in Social Security income to VA
      which then requires VA to identify discrepancies and work with beneficiaries
      to determine if adjusting benefits is appropriate. The majority of underpayments
      were due to human errors. The majority of unknown payments occurred because
      beneficiaries did not timely report changes in Social Security income to VA
      requiring due process before VA can make a final determination. If a sampled
      benefit payment is identified as a potential overpayment and has yet to enter
      due process or is currently in due process, a determination of whether it is
      proper or improper cannot be made.


      Automation was the best mitigation strategy because overpayments resulted from
      beneficiaries not timely providing information to VA, so VA identified the Social
      Security Administration as an alternative data source and implemented a quarterly
      Social Security income match. This match enables VA to identify variances between
      Social Security Administration income a beneficiary is receiving versus the
      amounts reported by a beneficiary to VA. Differences indicate potential changes
      in a beneficiary’s income, which could require a change to their pension benefit.
      Validating whether a change is needed and making changes if necessary, prevents
      future improper payments. The Social Security income match occurs quarterly
      and regulations require a 60-day due process period. The due process period
      protects the beneficiary from reduction adjustments being made to their pension
      payments without validation of the data VA has received from a third party.
      Therefore, VA must continue to make the pension payment and does not know if
      the payment is accurate or not until due process is complete. Audit was the
      best mitigation strategy in order to identify systemic discrepancies and reinforce
      adherence to policies and procedures to improve accurate pension rate decisions
      prior to payment. Training was the best mitigation strategy in order to improve
      awareness and increase skills to improve accurate pension rate decisions prior
      to payment.'
    act17_2: Although the overall error rate for this program increased from 10.86%
      in FY 2023 to 13.85% in FY 2024 (for a 2.99% increase), the program underwent
      improvements in FY 2024 that will improve its ability to reduce improper and
      unknown payments in the future. This included updating testing procedures to
      correctly differentiate monetary loss from unknown payments, obtaining more
      details during payment integrity testing to improve development of effective
      corrective actions, and improving corrective action and mitigation strategies
      planned for FY 2025. Additionally, the Cost-of-Living Adjustment error category
      was changed to within agency control and recategorized under Social Security
      Administration Income as the root cause to improve transparency related to VA’s
      access to SSA income data. This change reduced the Cost-of-Living Adjustment
      errors to zero in FY 2024. Dependency, incarceration, and death of beneficiary
      errors were reduced to zero in FY 2024 and focused reviews found no systemic
      causes for these errors. Claims processors were informed of these prior year
      errors and subsequently adjudicated the claims properly. VA's corrective actions
      and mitigation strategies have been evaluated by the Office of Inspector General
      during their FY 2024 annual audit and determined reasonable with no recommendations
      for improvement. The overpayments and underpayments were attributed to VA's
      failure to access data/information and unknown payments were attributed to being
      unable to determine whether proper or improper. Actions taken and planned regarding
      automation include conducting quarterly matches with the Social Security Administration
      to identify variances between Social Security Administration income a beneficiary
      is receiving versus the amounts reported by a beneficiary to VA. Differences
      indicate potential changes in a beneficiary's income, which could require a
      change to their pension benefit. Validating whether a change is needed and making
      changes if necessary, prevents future improper payments. Actions taken and planned
      regarding audit include randomly reviewing claims processors’ work to ensure
      policies and procedures are properly applied in making accurate pension rate
      decisions to prevent future improper payments. Actions planned regarding training
      include training staff to ensure policies and procedures are properly applied
      in making accurate pension rate decisions to prevent future improper payments.
    act17_3: VA updates corrective action plans annually based on testing results,
      and no less than quarterly throughout the fiscal year, to ensure actions are
      appropriately prioritized and designed to mitigate risks of improper and unknown
      payments. VA monitors progress and results of implementation on a quarterly
      basis. Additionally, an effectiveness review is performed annually to measure
      if an action reduced or is properly designed to reduce improper and unknown
      payments for a specific root cause based on a set benchmark. The annual effectiveness
      review process allows VA to create or update actions as necessary to ensure
      continued progress in the remediation of improper and unknown payments. If areas
      for improvement are identified, VA conducts a root cause analysis to refine
      the program's mitigation strategies to ensure they addressed and reduced root
      cause(s) of error. The increase in the Pension program's improper payment and
      unknown payment rate from 10.86% in FY 2023 to 13.85% in FY 2024, and the $99.31
      million increase in improper and unknown payments supports the effectiveness
      review determination that improvements are needed to at least two of the program's
      corrective actions in place in FY 2024. As part of the established corrective
      action process, the program reported improved corrective action and mitigation
      strategies planned for FY 2025.
    rnp3: The Pension program continues to prioritize and implement corrective actions
      and mitigation strategies that reduce improper payments. In FY 2024, VA performed
      an effectiveness review of actions developed and implemented in FY 2023. The
      purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness of corrective actions
      or mitigation strategies and whether the actions were effectively implemented
      and prioritized within the agency. The results for the Pension program indicated
      that of the three actions assessed, one was open and determined to be designed
      effectively to mitigate the root cause, and two were open and determined that
      improvements could be made to effectively mitigate the root cause. VA conducted
      a root cause analysis to refine the program's mitigation strategies to ensure
      they address and reduce root cause(s) of error and added training to corrective
      actions planned for FY 2025. Additionally, VA obtained more details during payment
      integrity testing this year for the program to improve development of effective
      corrective actions. VA will perform an effectiveness review in FY 2025 of the
      corrective action plans developed and implemented in FY 2024 due to the time
      needed to develop and implement actions as well as to impact the payment process.
      Results of this review will be reported in FY 2025.

    cyp20_2: The Pension reduction target is equal to the estimated future improper
      payment and unknown payment rate. VA establishes reduction targets by setting
      them lower than the current year improper payment estimates.  Reduction targets
      are a balance between being aggressive and realistic. One thing VA has learned
      from the many years it has been working to comply with improper payments legislation
      is that it can take three years from the point an error cause is isolated during
      testing to develop a corrective action, implement it, and then wait for payments
      to be made that can then be tested the following year since VA tests and reports
      improper payments one year in arrears.
    rap5: VA has not yet determined the tolerable rate.  VA is working to determine
      all requirements for establishing a tolerable rate per Office of Management
      and Budget guidance before attempting to establish tolerable rates.  At this
      time, VA is not aware of additional program needs.
    rap6: VA has not yet determined the tolerable rate.  VA is working to determine

      time, VA is not aware of additional program needs.
    rtp4_2: VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
      a tolerable rate not yet being met. VA continues to prioritize implementing
      appropriate corrective actions and mitigation strategies to reduce improper
      and unknown payments. The program plans to be compliant with the Payment Integrity
      Information Act of 2019 for FY 2024.

    rap5: 'VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
      a tolerable rate not yet being met. In March 2023, GAO acknowledged VA’s substantial
      reduction in improper and unknown payments using effective mitigation strategies
      and corrective actions (GAO-23-106285, IMPROPER PAYMENTS: Fiscal Year 2022 Estimates
      and Opportunities for Improvement). VA continues to prioritize implementing
      appropriate corrective actions and mitigation strategies and has adequate funding
      to implement improvements planned to internal controls, human capital, information
      systems and other infrastructure, as needed, over VA’s payment processing and
      procurement systems to continue reducing improper and unknown payments. VA will
      establish a tolerable rate if all applicable requirements are met.'
    rap6: At this time, VA is not aware of additional program needs. Therefore, VA
      has not requested additional resources to establish and maintain internal controls
      to reduce improper and unknown payments to the tolerable rate.

      targets are a balance between being aggressive and realistic. One thing VA has

      legislation is that it can take three to five years from the point an error
      cause is isolated during testing to develop a corrective action, implement it,
      and then wait for payments to be made that can then be tested the following
      year since VA tests and reports improper payments one year in arrears.
    rap5: 'VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing

      and unknown payments. VA is still actively reducing improper and unknown payments
      within its existing budget authority. VA considers the reduction of improper
      and unknown payments a critical part of its financial stewardship efforts.'
    rap6: At this time, VA is not aware of additional program needs. Therefore, VA
      has not requested additional resources to establish and maintain internal controls
      to reduce improper and unknown payments to establish and maintain payment integrity.
    rtp4_2: VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
      a tolerable rate not yet being met. VA continues to identify and implement appropriate
      corrective actions and mitigation strategies to further reduce the improper
      and unknown payment rate. VA has determined these corrective actions and mitigation
      strategies do not impede the mission and can be implemented cost-effectively
      within existing budget authority.

    cyp2_1: Overpayments within agency control occur when claims processors fail to
      use available beneficiary information to correctly process beneficiary awards.
      In some instances, beneficiary information may not be current, however, claims
      processors can use the available information as a basis for calculating correct
      benefit amounts or deferring actions or decisions until additional information
      is received from the beneficiary.  The program has the direct ability to prevent
      overpayments through the use of reviews to ensure proper policies and procedures
      are applied in the adjudication of claims and taking corrective action when
      errors resulting in improper payments are identified.

      income information to calculate correct benefit amounts when a beneficiary notifies
