  2022:
    pro1: "The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (Disaster Relief Act) (Public Law 115-123),\
      \ was signed into law on February 9, 2018, and provided $84.4 billion in emergency\
      \ supplemental appropriations to respond to and recover from recent hurricanes\
      \ and other disasters.  Of this amount, the Office of Head Start was provided\
      \ with $650 million in Disaster Relief Act funds to support Head Start and Early\
      \ Head Start recipients' response, recovery, and other activities directly related\
      \ to the consequences of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.  \n\nAt the time,\
      \ the 2017 hurricane season was among the most destructive in history, affecting\
      \ Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The extent of service\
      \ interruption and damage to property in the aftermath of these hurricanes varied\
      \ dramatically.  Immediately following the storm, agencies worked to re-open\
      \ closed centers or seek alternative means of service delivery.  Many programs\
      \ with severely damaged or destroyed Head Start or Early Head Start centers\
      \ substituted home-based services or temporarily moved services to alternate\
      \ locations.  Head Start and Early Head Start children, families, and staff\
      \ also experienced a range of mental health impacts when hurricanes disrupted\
      \ their lives and communities.\n\nThe Office of Head Start encouraged Head Start\
      \ recipients to engage in a careful assessment of programmatic and community\
      \ needs that took into consideration the immediate, temporary, and long-term\
      \ needs and associated costs resulting from the consequences of these hurricanes.\
      \  Immediately following the storm, many Head Start recipients provided support\
      \ to families in meeting their basic needs, including nutrition, health and\
      \ mental support, alternative care for children, and temporary shelter when\
      \ facilities were operable.  Head Start recipients with major facilities losses\
      \ engaged in planning and implementing long-term facilities activities such\
      \ as purchase, construction, and major renovation.  All impacted Head Start\
      \ recipients considered how best to prepare for similar weather-related disasters.\
      \  \n\nThe Office of Head Start provided intensive technical assistance to Head\
      \ Start recipients experiencing major facilities losses to support the development\
      \ of fundable applications meeting, state, and local building codes and applicable\
      \ child care licensing standards.\n\nHead Start recipients received and continue\
      \ to receive training and technical assistance in the administration of its\
      \ grants.  While the risk of improper payments cannot be eliminated, the Office\
      \ of Head Start remains committed to its ongoing monitoring and oversight of\
      \ not only Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 funds, but all funds issued under the\
      \ Head Start program."

    act17_1: null

    act17_3: null
    rnp3: The low improper payment rate indicates that the technical assistance and
      monitoring activities are effective.

    rnp3: Improper payment corrective action plans for the Head Start program addresses
      the specific cause of errors, typically in the form of targeted training and
      technical assistance.  For identified improper payments attributable to recipient
      actions, recipients may receive heightened training and technical assistance
      and/or consequences such as limitations on the availability of funds, disallowances,
      or future offset of funds in the event that improper payments are identified.   In
      addition to the improper payment error rate calculation activities, overpayments
      are identified and recovered through Single Audits as required by the Single
      Audit Act Amendments of 1996 and Department of Health and Human Services Office
      of Inspector General audits.  For each of the above activities, recipients are
      subject to disallowances for any expenditures not made in accordance with program
      regulations.   Further, federal awarding agencies must issue management decisions
      on audit findings within six months. The management decision must state whether
      the audit finding is sustained; the reasons for the decision; and the expected
      recipient action to repay disallowed costs, make financial adjustments, and/or
      take other action.  Issuance of a management decision is a high priority within
      the agency and the applicable office is held accountable for timely resolution
      of audit findings.

    cyp20_2: null
    rap5: Given that the improper and unknown payments error rate is less than 1%,
      it is indicative that the program has what is needed to maintain a low improper
      payments and unknown payments error rate. Had the program determined an improper
      payments and unknown payments tolerable rate, it is unlikely that the rate would
      be exceeded.
    rap6: While the FY 2023 President's Budget request for the Administration for
      Children and Families does not specifically mention resources requested to maintain
      the internal controls related to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (the Act),
      the Act provided a supplemental appropriation of $650 million.  Of this $650
      million,  $12,500,000 was specifically available for federal administrative
      expenses.
    rtp4_2: The tolerable rate for this program has not yet been determined because
      the program is a time-limited program.  Funding under the Bipartisan Budget
      Act of 2018 (Disaster Relief Act) (Public Law 115-123) must be used by recipients
      and sub-recipients for expenses directly related to the consequences of hurricanes
      Harvey, Irma, and Maria.  This funding was available for obligation by the Department
      of Health and Human Services through September 30, 2021, although OMB approved
      the Office of Head Start's request that the expenditure deadline for Disaster
      Relief Act funds be extended until September 30, 2026. Establishment of a baseline
      and therefore a tolerable rate, is not practical given specific funding related
      to the error rate calculation requirement, the limited time for expending funds,
      and the low error rate.
