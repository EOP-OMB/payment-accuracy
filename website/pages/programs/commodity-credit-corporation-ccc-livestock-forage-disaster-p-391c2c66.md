  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: The root cause of these improper payments was failure
      to access data information. In order to fully mitigate these errors, program
      software will need to be modified, specifically to incorporate reading an applicant’s
      farm records to properly identify owners, operators, and other tenants and perform
      other cross checks to ensure the proper supporting documentation such as a lease
      or CCC-855 has been completed for the associated grazed acreage claimed.  Currently,
      Farm Service Agency’s information technology budget is not adequately funded
      to enhance existing software.  Farm Service Agency will request Commodity Credit
      Corporation Section 4 and 11 funding during the Fiscal Year 2025 Commodity Credit

    rnp3: National Livestock Forage Disaster Program training is held every year to
      review policy, common program questions and to discuss root causes of improper
      payments and policy review associated with those findings.  Beginning in 2020,
      this training was conducted at a more localized level providing smaller sessions
      to individual states as they triggered for program implementation.  The root
      cause of administrative errors are primarily isolated to failures to follow
      compliance and acreage reporting policy.  An Acreage reporting review is currently
      underway for Fiscal Year 2022 to help determine the root cause(s) for failure
      to access data/information and statutory requirements not met errors, including
      late-filed deficiencies. Farm Service Agency plans to utilize the review results
      to establish strategies that will improve program processes and establish accountability
      measures for the remainder of fiscal year 2022 and for fiscal year 2023. Throughout
      the fiscal year, National, State, and County program managers will continue
      to evaluate areas where policy needs revising or to be clarified, and additional
      training is necessary.

      In addition, Farm Service Agency completed an analysis of improper payment findings
      for the program.  To address acreage reporting issues, Deputy Administrator
      for Farm Programs has created a task force who met in August 2023 to develop
      recommendations to inform a timeline of adoption. One of the

      primary objectives of this task force is to address improper payment findings
      related to the acreage reporting process. The team reviewed policies and software
      enhancements to identify possible changes that would mitigate risks associated
      with improper payments. The task force will develop proposed solutions and training
      materials. The team will provide these recommendations to Deputy Administrator
      for Farm Programs by December 31, 2023.'
  2024:
    act17_1: The root cause of these improper payments was statutory requirements
      of program not met.  The agency has established various task forces that consist
      of State and county office specialists to discuss issues, findings, and suggest
      solutions relating to administrative errors in the failure to obtain the required
      supporting documentation and proper acreage reporting. The outcome was identifying
      needed software enhancements, developing training opportunities, and issuing
      policy updates in agency handbooks.  These corrective actions are focused on
      the cause of the improper payments.
    act17_2: The root cause of these improper payments was statutory requirements
      of program not met.  Corrective actions such as training and awareness have
      had a positive impact, which is represented in a reduction in Livestock Forage
      Disaster Program’s Payment Integrity Information Act error rate in Fiscal Year
      2024 compared to Fiscal Year 2023. Overall, Livestock Forage Disaster Program’s
      improper payment percentage has remained between 9-13 percent for the last three
      years, which included many pandemic and disaster related ad hoc programs which
      were being administered during this time with limited resources. These corrective
      actions are adequate to address the cause of the improper payments.
    act17_3: "Actions taken to reduce Livestock Forage Disaster Program’s improper\
      \ payment percentage have been effective.  In August 2018. Farm Service Agency\
      \ released a software update that integrated the Crop Acreage Reporting System\
      \ software in the Livestock Forage Disaster Program application software.  With\
      \ this implementation, acres or animal units are now interfaced directly from\
      \ producer acreage reports, which are a requirement for Livestock Forage Disaster\
      \ Program, directly into the Livestock Forage Disaster Program application software.\
      \  This replaced the manual entries and significantly mitigated errors of calculating\
      \ the total of eligible acreage.   In Fiscal Year 2021, Livestock Forage Disaster\
      \ Program’s improper payment percentage decreased to 8 percent.  Livestock Forage\
      \ Disaster Program’s improper payment percentage has increased in two of the\
      \ last three fiscal years in part due to increased participation in Livestock\
      \ Forage Disaster Program, and a lack of funding for software enhancements.\
      \ \n\nActions taken enhancing software to interface eligible acreage or animal\
      \ units and establishing Livestock Forage Disaster Program monthly trainings\
      \ with State Livestock Forage Disaster Program specialists, raising improper\
      \ payment awareness. All actions have contributed to reducing Livestock Forage\
      \ Disaster Program’s improper payment percentage. These corrective actions will\
      \ be effectively implemented and prioritized within the agency to reduce improper\
      \ payments.\n"
    rnp3: Incorrect acreage reporting has been a reoccurring finding for Livestock
      Forage Disaster Program. Accurate accounting can be complex when producers have
      multiple fields, and especially in multiple counties, or when determined animal
      units are converted to acres. While training has kept these findings from increasing,
      automation enhancements are needed to fully assure that administrative errors
      are mitigated, however funding has not been available.  Specific national training
      has been conducted as recently as July 15-19, 2024. All trainings are recorded
      and posted on Deputy Administrator for Farm Program’s Livestock Forage Program
      Training site. Further, Safety Net Division holds monthly Livestock Forage Disaster
      Program trainings with State Office Livestock Forage Disaster Program specialists
      to discuss findings and address any questions. All calls are recorded and posted
      on Deputy Administrator for Farm Program’s Livestock Forage Disaster Program
      Training SharePoint site. These corrective actions are sufficient to mitigate
      the program’s $134.90 million of improper payment dollars related to statutory
      requirements not met.

      \ capacity to timely and adequately address various compliance issues and requirements.\
      \  Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division are\
      \ evaluating the current set up to seek improvements as it relates to Farm Service\
      \ Agency program compliance.  In addition, Farm Service Agency’s existing staff\
      \ continues to be stretched with the responsibilities of training new staff,\
      \ administering Farm Service Agency programs, performing existing County Operations\
      \ Reviewers duties, and addressing new compliance requirements, all as collateral\
      \ duties. Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division\
      \ are developing a new work plan to better address this issue and goal by first\
      \ quarter fiscal year 2023 to define an improved workplan to support compliance\
      \ review.\n\nInformation Systems’ Needs – Farm Service Agency is positioning\
      \ itself to take preventive measures through automated processes that are built\
      \ into business systems to reduce errors.  Automation improves productivity\
      \ and enforces procedural compliance; therefore, Farm Service Agency is exploring\
      \ better approaches to integrate internal controls functions into the implementation\
      \ of programs, as well as maintenance of an existing program systems. Given\
      \ these efforts, the Agency is planning to request Congressional funding for\
      \ enhancing:  1) transactional program systems/software to quickly meet the\
      \ implementation demands of pandemic, emergency, and disaster programs and 2)\
      \ interface systems to allow data sharing and eliminate manual/duplicative entries\
      \ and processes. \n\nSeveral transactional program systems and software “work\
      \ arounds” and manual processes still exist that are contributing to the increase\
      \ of program improper payments. Funding is needed to resolve current deficiencies\
      \ and build internal controls requirements within these systems. \n\nFrom an\
      \ internal controls oversight perspective, Farm Service Agency has invested\
      \ in the Internal Review Documentation and Tracking System and continues to\
      \ incorporate manual-paper based program reviews and spot-checks into automated\
      \ processes within the system.  The objectives for Internal Review Documentation\
      \ and Tracking System are to improve oversight capabilities to State and National\

      \ results for program analysis and enrichment. This effort is ongoing and is\
      \ planned through fiscal year 2024. \n\nOther Infrastructures Needs - As part\
      \ of the Agency’s new integrated compliance plan, the design will incorporate\
      \ further actions to address meeting program reduction targets, including but\
      \ not limited to: 1) changing the current sampling methodology to using better\
      \ sound statistical, survey, and data collection methodologies that elevate\
      \ past issues of  “oversampling” and inefficient use of resources, while also\
      \ ensuring the program dollars are delivered to all producers who are legally\
      \ entitled to them; 2) utilizing a risk-based approach, where program risks\
      \ and risk tolerances are identified to allow the right internal controls to\
      \ be put in place, establish program metrics that gages the success of meeting\
      \ objectives and need for improvements; 3) integrating a more proactive use\
      \ of data mining to identify program key performance indicators, anomalies,\
      \ fraud, waste, and abuse; and 4) performing a validity reassessment of current\
      \ program oversight processes, such as oversight checklists, redelegation of\
      \ authorities for approvals, etc.  \n\nThese actions will also assist in capturing\
      \ program impacts to targeted arenas of the historically underserved groups\
      \ and determining where increased efforts are needed to improve accessibility\

      effectively.  A continuous evaluation system which monitors the effectiveness
      of internal controls is in place but is not sufficient to reduce improper payments
      rates.
    rap6: The fiscal year 2024 President’s Budget and the fiscal year 2025 Department
      Estimates submitted to Office of Management and Budget does not include funding
      levels to support the required software enhancements to increase application
      controls.  Due to budget constraints for the agency approved funding levels,
      the funding required to build automated internal controls within the existing
      systems is not included.
    rtp4_2: The agency does not have sufficient resources to add needed internal controls,
      human resources, and information systems to reduce the improper payment and
      unknown payments.  The agency will continue to strategically take the necessary
      steps to strengthen internal control measures, establish uniform consistency
      for compliance processes, and improve accountability. A continuous evaluation
      system which monitors the effectiveness of internal controls is in place but
      is not sufficient to reduce improper payments rates.  Lastly, agency will require
      key resources to continue its progression towards strengthening internal controls
      and addressing the inconsistencies with certain programs reporting more than
      the statutory improper payment threshold.

    cyp20_2: With the implementation of the current corrective actions and the planned
      corrective actions for the program, it is the agency’s anticipation that the
      projected reduction target will be less than the estimated future improper payment
      rate.
    rap5: A tolerable rate for Livestock Forage Disaster Program has not been established;
      however, the Agency is in the process of establishing additional internal controls
      for its permanent programs such as Livestock Forage Disaster Program. For example,
      Farm Service Agency is in the process of establishing a monitoring system to
      assure that county offices review payments before being issued. The system also
      has an accountability component to identify offices that struggle to disburse
      proper payments. Once implemented, Farm Service Agency will be in a position
      to determine a tolerable rate based on established data.  Farm Service Agency
      will request Commodity Credit Corporation Section 4 and 11 funding during the
      Fiscal Year 2025 Commodity Credit Corporation budget request and Working Capital
      Fund request drills.  Estimated funding requirements for system enhancement
      is $2 million.
    rap6: In order to reduce Livestock Forage Disaster Program’s improper payments,
      system enhancements and training for staff is required; however, Farm Service
      Agency’s information technology budget is not adequately funded to implement
      the requested enhancements.  Farm Service Agency will request Commodity Credit
      Corporation Section 4 and 11 funding during the Fiscal Year 2025 Commodity Credit
      Corporation budget request and Working Capital Fund request drills.  Estimated
      funding requirements for system enhancement is $2 million.
    rtp4_2: The agency’s target rate for Livestock Forage Disaster Program is to have
      an improper payment percentage below 10 percent, however this may not represent
      the definition of a “tolerable rate”.  All corrective actions taken by the agency
      have been implemented with the goal to be within the 10 percent threshold.

    cyp2_1: The Farm Service Agency administers all of its programs within the agency.
      Livestock Forage Disaster Program overpayments within the agency’s control are
      the result of Failure to access data/information.  The overpayments are due
      to County Office staff did not adhere to first level controls to prevent improper
      payments to ensure the correct carrying capacity is used for the specific forage
      and pasture type.  To prevent the improper payments for occurring, District
      Directors are required to review the first five program applications received
      in the Service Center.  Farm Service Agency has implemented a SharePoint system
      in fiscal year 2023 for those reviews to be documented and to report any identified
      program weaknesses to the National Office.  The agency's National Office Program
      Manager will monitor the SharePoint system to proactively identify any program
      weakness throughout the current program year application period.

      information, and the overpayments were within the agency control (program administered
      by the Farm Service Agency).


      These errors primarily involve administrative oversights such as failure to
      obtain supporting documentation and written leases or form CCC-855 Lease Certification
      to support the application, and failure to ensure the lease documentation complies
      with the established policies.  Through software enhancements and training on
      proper processes for obtaining required supporting documentation and written
      leases/CCC-855 Lease Certifications, these corrective actions should reduce
      Livestock Forage Disaster Program’s overall improper payment dollars and percentage.  However,
      in order to effectively reduce the improper payments, system enhancements are
      required.  Farm Service Agency’s information technology budget is not adequately
      funded to modify software to incorporate farm record data to properly identify
      owners, operators, and other tenants and other cross checks to alert County
