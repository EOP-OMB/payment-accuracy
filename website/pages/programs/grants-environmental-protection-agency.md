  2022:
    pro1: "The Grants payment stream is not susceptible to significant improper payments\
      \ reaching that status during FY 2022.  For the Agency’s grants payment stream,\
      \ overpayments principally consist of unallowable costs or lack of supporting\
      \ documentation. When overpayments arise, EPA seeks to recover them either by\
      \ establishing a receivable and collecting money from the recipient or by offsetting\
      \ future payment requests. The Agency follows established debt collection procedures\
      \ to recapture overpayments. \n. EPA also seeks to prevent improper payments.\
      \ Prior to the issuance of a grant award, OGD’s Compliance Team conduct pre-award\
      \ certification of non-profit recipients that receive awards in excess of $200K\
      \ to ensure their written policies and procedures specify acceptable internal\
      \ controls for safeguarding federal funds. Re-certifications are conducted every\
      \ four years. Grants Management Officers (GMOs) concur on all certifications."

  2024:
    act17_1: The agency is taking a two-pronged approach. One is improved training
      and information among agency staff. This addresses errors that new, inexperienced
      staff. The other is making agency staff regular available for live Q & A sessions
      increases the understanding of grant recipients in etermining the appropriate
      timing of their grant draws.
    act17_2: The Grants program is no longer considered susceptible to significant
      improper payments. While some additional improvements are planned for this coming
      fiscal year, no extraordinary efforts are necessary.
    act17_3: The Corrective Actions requirements are included in mandatory trainings
      and are reviewed at monthly staff meetings.
    rnp3: 'The agency anticipates the steps taken in FY 2024 along with the planned
      activities in the forthcoming fiscal year will be adequate. As the agency Grants
      Program has a combined improper payment questioned cost rate below the 1.5%
      threshold rate, no additional efforts are planned.

      How the corrective action plan affects "unknown payments" is not certain because
      the agency did not have any this year.'
