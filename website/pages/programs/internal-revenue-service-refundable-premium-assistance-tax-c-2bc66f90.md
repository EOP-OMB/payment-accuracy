    Description_Action_Taken: The IRS will continue to hold the annual Dependent Database
      (DDb) meetings with stakeholders in Taxpayer Services, Small Business & Self
      Employed, and Information Technology divisions, to review and adjust the value
      of prior-year compliance filters for audit selection of returns claiming the
      Premium Tax Credit (PTC). Based on analysis of prior-year data, the IRS refines
      the IRS filters to better prioritize returns with higher likelihoods of errors;
      this helps prevent improper payments by intervening earlier in the process.
      As mentioned, throughout the IRS's history of refundable tax credit management,
      the primary root causes of refundable tax credit-related improper payments is
      reliance on taxpayer self-certification of an accurate return and the lack of
      a pre-approval process. Because taxpayers are not required to prove their eligibility
      for RTCs upfront, errors (both unintentional and intentional) can occur. Improved
      compliance filters can catch these issues after returns are filed but before
      payments are issued, helping to reduce improper payments. The primary result
      of this approach is enhanced targeting of resources to areas in which errors
      are most likely to occur. By helping taxpayers file accurate returns upfront,
      quickly fixing errors that delay refunds and ensuring taxpayers claim the credits
      and deductions for which they are eligible, the IRS will correct payment accuracy
      issues without substantially increasing the burden on taxpayers and the IRS.

    Description_Action_Taken: The IRS will continue to leverage data-sharing agreements
      with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Medicare
      and Medicaid Services (CMS) to access critical information that aids in validating
      eligibility for the Premium Tax Credit (PTC). This data-sharing involves the
      exchange of key data points, such as income thresholds and enrollment in a qualified
      health plan. With this information, the IRS can more accurately assess whether
      taxpayers meet the eligibility requirements for the PTC. Cross Enterprise Sharing
      allows the IRS to detect discrepancies in taxpayer filings, such as the taxpayer
      not being in a qualified health plan and prevent improper payments during the
      return processing stage. An additional root cause of improper payments of refundable
      tax credits (RTCs), in addition to data needed does not exist and inability
      to access data, is taxpayer misreporting or misunderstanding of eligibility
      requirements. Given that RTCs rely heavily on taxpayer self-reported information,
      taxpayers may inaccurately claim the PTC due to misunderstanding income limits
      or dependency. By leveraging third-party data sources from CMS, the IRS can
      verify key elements of returns. This is especially important given the lack
      of a pre-approval process for these credits.

    Description_Action_Taken: The IRS held its annual Dependent Database (DDb) meeting
      with stakeholders in Taxpayer Services, Small Business & Self Employed, and
      IT divisions, to evaluate the effectiveness of prior-year compliance filters
      and enhance future filters for audit selection of returns claiming the Premium
      Tax Credit (PTC) and to identify improvement opportunities for next filing season.
      This process involves analyzing data from prior years to fine-tune criteria
      used to flag potentially erroneous returns. For example, patterns from prior
      filing seasons can reveal common errors, and by refining the IRS filters, the
      IRS can better prioritize returns with higher likelihoods of errors and prevent
      improper payments by intervening earlier in the process. As mentioned, throughout
      the IRS's history of refundable tax credit management, the primary root causes
      of improper payments of refundable tax credits (RTCs) are reliance on taxpayer
      self-certification of an accurate return and the lack of a pre-approval process.
      Because taxpayers are not required to prove their eligibility for RTCs upfront
      (as would be the case with a traditional payment program), errors can occur
      due to taxpayer misrepresentation or misunderstanding of key points of eligibility.

    rnp3: 'The IRS runs various automated checks of certain data on a tax return before
      payment of a refund but is otherwise limited in its ability to question and
      correct the taxpayer’s claim. The IRS must deploy a variety of costly enforcement
      tools, including audits, to verify the information on the tax return and then
      prevent

      the payment of tax refunds or collect any tax due. As a result, the IRS allocates
      a disproportionate amount of its enforcement resources to audit returns that
      claim one or more RTCs. This creates several problems. Because lower-income
      taxpayers make up the majority of those claiming RTCs, they are subjected to
      a

      disproportionate number of audits (RTC claimants are audited at almost three
      times the rate of other taxpayers.) Since lower-income taxpayers make up a significant
      portion of taxpayers claiming RTCs, auditing these taxpayers can lead to a negative
      perception of IRS’s treatment of taxpayers. This runs

      counter to the IRS’s mission of fairness to all taxpayers.


      The IRS has internal controls in place to verify eligibility when data is available.
      Treasury and IRS analyses have consistently found that RTC overclaims are largely
      attributable to the statutory design and complex eligibility requirements, and
      not rooted in internal control weaknesses, financial management deficiencies
      or reporting failures. The IRS has a strong internal control environment around
      refundable credit programs administered and makes decisions based on overall
      cost-benefit considerations. The IRS annually reviews and enhances its refundable
      credits compliance plan that addresses erroneous claims. Therefore, legislative
      changes are the most effective means of addressing the causes of these improper

    rnp3: The IRS has the ability to identify Net Premium Tax Credit (PTC) errors
      by type. Correlating remediation efforts to success is challenging. Given its
      limited authority to directly prevent and stop these errors, the IRS focuses
      on positively influencing taxpayer behavior and working with paid preparers
      and tax preparation software/online filing service providers. Further, the IRS
      has sought legislative authority to enhance verification procedures for taxpayers
      claiming the PTC. Taxpayer education and outreach efforts, such as the IRS's
      annual Dependent Database (DDb) meetings, inform taxpayers about program eligibility
      requirements.
  2024:
    act17_1: 'The primary challenge in administering refundable tax credits (RTCs),
      such as the Premium Tax Credit (Net PTC), is the complexity of the credits''
      statutory eligibility requirements. As a result, the key root causes of RTC
      improper payments are as follows: (1) the lack of a pre-approval process and
      inability to authenticate eligibility at the point of return filing; (2) taxpayer
      misrepresentation or misunderstanding of key points of eligibility, especially
      for self-employment or other income not reported to the IRS by third-parties;
      and (3) the inability for the IRS to wholesale deny refunds. Because of these
      root causes, the IRS has to rely on taxpayer self-certification of an accurate
      return. The IRS has implemented a series of corrective actions focused on mitigating
      these root causes. The annual Dependent Database (DDb) meetings focus on reviewing
      and adjusting compliance filters used in audit selection, which allows the IRS
      to detect errors earlier. The IRS also cross-collaborates with the Department
      of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Social Security Administration (SSA)
      and the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) to share data that would
      enable the IRS to identify discrepancies in taxpayer claims. Finally, the IRS
      has invested in taxpayer education and outreach efforts, through such venues
      as the IRS''s Nationwide Tax Forums and Latino Tax Fest, to educate tax preparers
      about their responsibilities to verify taxpayer eligibility before filing claims.
      The IRS is re-aligning its efforts to further its strategic initiatives; accordingly,
      the IRS is investing in taxpayer outreach and education, in lieu of conducting
      additional pre-refund audits. By helping taxpayers file accurate returns upfront,
      quickly fixing errors that delay refunds and ensuring taxpayers claim the credits

      All of these corrective actions are strategically designed to address the root
      causes of improper payments by improving the accuracy of filed returns and mitigating
      the risks associated with taxpayer self-certification.'
    act17_2: The regulatory structure of refundable tax credits (RTCs), which lacks
      a pre-approval process and causes the IRS to rely heavily on taxpayer self-certification

      critical in determining which area gain focus. For example, the IRS is re-aligning

      that its corrective actions are continuously monitored, effectively implemented
      and reprioritized based on their ability to address the root causes of RTC improper
      payments.
    rnp3: 'The challenge in administering refundable tax credits (RTCs) is that RTCs
      do not have the characteristics of a typical payment program. The fundamental
      root causes of the Premium Tax Credit improper payments are as follows: (1)
      there is a statutory lack of a required pre-approval process; (2) an inability
      to wholesale deny payments (refunds) and (3) the information needed to verify
      taxpayer claims of eligibility belongs primarily to the taxpayer without any
      third-party data source available at the time of filing, thus requiring the
      IRS to rely on taxpayer self-certification that all return information is accurate.
      RTCs are managed within and follow the regulatory scheme of tax administration
      and enforcement. At a lower level, the root causes are that, at the time of
      filing/payment: (a) there''s an inability to authenticate eligibility (typically
      due to a series of complex eligibility rules, many with relationship and residency
      tests containing with many nuances); (b) there''s instances where taxpayer income
      is misreported, particularly related to self-employment income and other income
      not reported to the IRS by a third party; and (c) there''s a turnover of taxpayer
      who receive certain credits for the first time and fail to understand the complex
      requirements of claiming the credit. Pursuant to federal statute, the IRS generally
      does not have the capability to deny even incorrect claims, given the lack of
      math authority. However, the IRS''s information technology platform includes
      a number of filters that the IRS uses to monitor the accuracy of eligibility
      rules compliance and payment certification. The annual Dependent Database (DDb)
      meetings, collaborations/data sharing with other federal agencies and outreach/education
      efforts aid the Service in mitigating the impact of these root causes. Lastly,
      the IRS has a number of outreach and education programs in place, to help taxpayers
      and tax preparers understand the program eligibility rules and file accurate
      returns claiming RTCs.'
Description: ' The Net Premium Tax Credit (PTC) is a refundable credit that helps
  eligible individuals and families cover the premiums for their health insurance
  purchased through the Marketplace. Approximately $0.57B of Net PTC overclaims are
  from the inability to authenticate eligibility because the data needed does not
  exist. Approximately $0.09B of Net PTC overclaims are from program design limitations.
  Barriers caused by program design occur when information needed to confirm payment
  accuracy is not available at the time the return is processed. Authentication is
  difficult because the IRS relies primarily on the self-reported information from
  the taxpayers and there is a lack of databases available that would help IRS determine
  eligibility.'

    rap5: To reduce overclaim rates to less than 10 percent, to meet Payment Integrity
      Information Act (PIIA) compliance standards, the IRS estimated, in a Fiscal
      Year 2021 study, that it would need additional or reallocated resources of $2.5
      billion to audit 4.2 million additional RTC returns in the pre-refund environment.
      If the IRS must reallocate enforcement resources to be compliant with PIIA,
      a substantial  loss in enforcement revenue, estimated at $6.4 billion, would
      result because the IRS would divert resources from more valuable programs and
      tax gap elements to audits of RTC returns. Moreover, such enforcement actions
      would place substantial burden on low-income taxpayers through increased audits
      and delayed refunds, violating the IRS requirement of enforcing the tax law
      with integrity and fairness. As such, IRS has long held that focusing enforcement
      resources on the larger tax gap is a more efficient and cost effective way to
      minimize the tax gap and maximize tax collections. We further support the reporting
      of RTC overclaims within the Tax Gap Analysis to reflect better how the IRS
      approaches taxpayer compliance relative to the U.S. tax system.
    rap6: 'For FY 2023 , the Administration included the following proposals in its
      Budget submission:

      (1) Increase Oversight of Paid Tax Return Preparers.

      The proposal would amend Title 31, U.S. Code (Money and Finance) to provide
      the Secretary with explicit authority to regulate all paid preparers of Federal
      tax returns, including by establishing mandatory minimum competency standards.


      (2) Expand and increase penalties for return preparation and e-filing –

      The proposal would increase and expand the IRS’s authority to address noncompliance
      or inappropriate behavior by paid tax return preparers and e-file providers.
      First, it would increase the penalty amounts that apply to paid tax return preparers
      for willful, reckless or unreasonable understatements, as well as for forms
      of noncompliance that do not involve an understatement of tax. Second, the proposal
      would establish new penalties for the appropriation of Preparer Tax Identification
      Numbers (PTINs) and Electronic Filing Identification

      Numbers (EFINs) and for failing to disclose the use of a paid tax return preparer.
      Third, the proposal would increase the limitations period during which the penalty

    cyp20_2: 'The FY 2024 Estimated Improper Payment Rate is the same as the FY 2023
      Improper Payment Rate. The unique nature of tax administration means that traditional
      target-setting as a means of approaching reductions in RTC improper payments
      will be ineffective. The RTC statute is such that IRS has limited

      authority to make changes to the claims during return processing. More so, most
      of the eligibility and credit determination requirements depends on factors
      that are generally not known by the IRS at the time of filing. The IRS heavily
      relies on taxpayer-provided information without verifiability by third-party

      sources. The complexity of the law contributes to confusion around eligibility
      requirements and is one of the major contributing factors of improper payments.
      Error prevention and recoveries are achieved through time-consuming and resource-intensive
      examinations and other compliance activities. IRS does not have the resources
      to audit every return claiming RTCs, and the adjustments able to be attained
      through this process are small relative to the amount of improper payments estimated
      for the program. Without legislative change to greatly improve effective tools
      to administer these credits, the improper payment rate

      will not change significantly.'
    rap5: The IRS has support with respect to internal control, human capital and
      information system and other infrastructure to reduce Net Premium Tax Credit
      (PTC) Improper Payments and Unknown Payments to a tolerable rate. The issue
      with PTC is statutory program design and reliance on taxpayer self-certification.
      The IRS has a strong internal control environment around PTC  and makes decisions
      based on overall cost-benefit considerations, with a well-trained, technically
      capable program staff.
    rap6: The IRS is realigning resources internally to accelerate progress against
      its strategic priorities. The IRS will substantially be reducing the number
      of correspondence audits focused specifically on certain refundable credits,
      including the Net Premium Tax Credit (PTC). Focusing on helping taxpayer submit
      accurate filings upfront will increase payment accuracy while reducing administrative
      burdens for the IRS and the tax filer.
    rtp4_2: Similar to the previous year, IRS has not yet determined a tolerable rate.
      Reducing the improper payment rate to less than 10 percent would require significant
      restructuring of the RTC programs, to include legislative action. Accordingly,
      the IRS does not have a current target date to report the tolerable rate.

      (RTCs) Improper Payments and Unknown Payments to a tolerable rate. The issue
      with RTCs is statutory program design and reliance on taxpayer self-certification.
      The IRS has a strong internal control environment around RTCs and makes decisions
      based on overall cost-benefit considerations, with a well-trained, technically
      capable program staff whose tenure far exceeds that of other agencies. The Treasury
      Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) has traditionally reported
      that the issue with improper payments is not an internal control deficiency.


      Reducing the improper payment rate to less than 10 percent would require significant
      restructuring of the RTC programs, to include legislative action.'
    rap6: "Further improving the integrity of refundable tax credit (RTC) programs\
      \ will take actions beyond our control.  We have proposed various legislative\
      \ changes over the years aimed at providing more effective tools for managing\
      \ RTCs.  For the FY 2025 budget submission, the Administration included the\
      \ following proposals:\n\n1. Expand and increase Penalties for Return Preparation\
      \ and E-filing - The proposal would increase and expand the IRS’s authority\
      \ to address noncompliance or inappropriate behavior by paid tax return preparers\
      \ and e-file providers.  First, it would increase the penalty amounts that apply\
      \ to paid tax return preparers for willful, reckless or unreasonable understatements,\
      \ as well as for forms of noncompliance that do not involve an understatement\
      \ of tax.  Second, the proposal would establish new penalties for the appropriation\
      \ of Preparer Tax Identification Numbers (PTINs) and Electronic Filing Identification\
      \ Numbers (EFINs) and for failing to disclose the use of a paid tax return preparer.\
      \  Third, the proposal would increase the limitations period during which the\
      \ penalty for a failure to furnish the preparer’s identifying number may be\
      \ assessed from three years to six years.  Fourth, the proposal would clarify\
      \ the Secretary’s authority to regulate the conduct and suitability of persons\
      \ who participate in the authorized e-file program, including setting standards\
      \ and imposing sanctions to protect the integrity of the e-file program.  \n\
      \n2. Increase Oversight of Paid Tax Return Preparers - The proposal would amend\
      \ Title 31, U.S. Code (Money and Finance) to provide the Secretary with explicit\
      \ authority to regulate all paid preparers of federal tax returns, including\
      \ by establishing mandatory minimum competency standards. \n\nThese statutory\
      \ changes may help reduce RTC errors to some degree.  However, a meaningful\
      \ reduction in the estimated error rate is unlikely without independent data\
      \ sources through which the IRS can verify taxpayer-provided information and\
      \ additional time and resources for the IRS to address any issues identified."
    rtp4_2: "Similar to previous years, reporting a tolerable rate has not yet been\
      \ determined. It is important to note the Refundable Tax Credits (RTCs) do not\
      \ have the characteristics of a typical payment program. The primary root causes\
      \ of improper payments of RTCs are the inability to authenticate eligibility\
      \ at return filing because the data needed does not exist, and taxpayer income\
      \ misreporting related to self-employment income and other income where the\
      \ income is not reported to the IRS by a third party. Put simply, payment eligibility\
      \ and certification decisions for RTCs are made by the taxpayer during the filing\
      \ process. \n\nReducing the improper payment rate to less than 10 percent would\
      \ require significant restructuring of the RTC programs, to include legislative\
      \ action. Accordingly, the IRS does not have a current target date to report\
      \ the tolerable rate."
