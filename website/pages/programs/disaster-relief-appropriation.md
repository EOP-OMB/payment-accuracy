    pro1: 'As required by OMB Memorandum M-18-14, Implementation of Internal Controls
      and Grant Expenditures for the Disaster Related Appropriations, management conducted
      statistical sampling and testing of the FY2021 outlays for Hurricane Harvey,
      Hurricane Matthew, and Hurricane Irma activity

      (reported under the Disaster Relief Appropriation program). In FY2022 NASA''s
      DRA disbursements totaled $16.47 million. The results of the review yielded
      no identification of improper payments or unknown payments, thus a 100 percent
      payment accuracy rate.'
