Actions_By_Year:
  2023:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Utilizing improper and unknown payments information
      from AmeriCorps’ annual Payment Integrity Assessment, the working group will
      identify the root cause drivers behind the improper and unknown payments. Based
      on this information, the group will implement a plan of action steps aimed at
      reducing these areas of non-compliance. The training and resources will focus
      on the identified improper payment root cause drivers. The agency also provided
      resolution packets to grantees at the conclusion of the FY 2022 assessment linking
      specific root cause drivers of improper payments to the corresponding applicable
      statute, regulation, and available trainings. This will continue for the FY
      2023 assessment.

  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: AmeriCorps plans to continue to provide training and
      resources to grantees to ensure proper utilization of grant funds. AmeriCorps
      has a Payment Integrity Corrective Action Plan working group that includes accountable
      program officials and key agency stakeholders. The working group has created
      training and resources targeted at the root cause drivers of improper payments
      which are available on the agency’s website or grantee training platform (LITMOS).
      The working group plans to analyze the FY 2023 improper payments root cause
      drivers and explore opportunities to create new resources or expand on those
      that currently exist in FY 2024.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app3_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: Regarding the provision of training as a corrective
      action, AmeriCorps established a Payment Integrity Corrective Action Plan working
      group in FY 2022 to identify corrective actions the agency could take to address
      its improper payment rate. Utilizing improper and unknown payment information
      from AmeriCorps’ annual Payment Integrity Assessment, the working group identified
      the root cause drivers behind the improper and unknown payments. Based on this
      information, the group implemented a plan of action steps aimed at reducing
      these areas of non-compliance. The training and resources focus on the identified
      improper payment root cause drivers. The agency also provided resolution packets
      to grantees at the conclusion of the FY 2022 assessment linking specific root
      cause drivers of improper payments to the corresponding applicable statute,
      regulation, and available training. This will continue for the FY 2023 assessment.
