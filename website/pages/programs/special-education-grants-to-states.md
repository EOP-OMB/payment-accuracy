    Description_Action_Taken: 'The Department has worked internally to address accounting
      errors that resulted in

      rounding errors made by the recipients of the funds. The small amounts identified
      relative to the program outlays would not usually present an opportunity to
      efficiently use resources to attempt to recover.'

    pro1: 'Unknown Payments (UPs) were the primary driver of this program’s high estimated
      Improper Payment (IP) and Unknown Payment (UP) rate reported in FY22. The UPs
      identified in FY22 were the result of lack of documentation due to the delayed
      start of the study.


      The Department implemented effective mitigation strategies in FY23 which resulted
      in the elimination of UPs, and subsequently the significant reduction of the
      estimated IP and UP rate in FY23. The strategies implemented are as follows:


      1. The Department began the FY23 study earlier in the fiscal year, providing
      sufficient time for State Education Agencies (SEAs) to obtain and provide supporting
      documentation from Local Education

      Agencies (LEAs) for the program’s payments.


      2. The Department also provided SEAs with targeted technical assistance and
      training. This assistance encompassed technical assistance meetings with certain
      states, written guidance, and payment documentation criteria guidance.


      Additionally, The Department formally issued its policy on Payment Integrity,
      providing guidance to agency employees, in Fiscal Year 2023.'

      to address the unknown payments identified at the conclusion of the study. For
      each unknown payment sample in the study, the responsible program office will
      provide a written determination whether the payment was proper or improper.
      The program offices will communicate to their subprogram grantees regarding
      obtaining and/or providing supporting documentation to the Department, as part
      of its efforts to comply with PIIA. Messaging to grantees will include establishing

      expectations by providing grantees with background on PIIA, the anticipated
      timeline, the importance of being attentive and responsive to the payment integrity
      team’s communications and requests, and the type of documentation requested
      under the Fiscal Year 2023 methodology to substantiate sampled payments.'
