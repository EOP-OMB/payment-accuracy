    rnp4: 'The FCC works through it''s program administrator, USAC to complete payment
      recapture audits known as Beneficiary and Contributor Audit Program (BCAP).
      BCAP audits are designed to identify overpayments that must be recaptured, assess
      compliance with FCC rules, and deter waste, fraud, and abuse. Further, the FCC
      works through USAC’s improper payment testing program known as Payment

      Quality Assurance (PQA). Through PQA, USAC utilizes a statistical sampling methodology
      to estimate the annual amount of improper payments in the USF-HC, USF-LL, USF-RHC,
      and USF-S&L programs.  The goal of the PQA assessment plan is to estimate an
      improper payment error rate based on non-compliance with FCC rules. To recover
      improper payments, the FCC and USAC have implemented an enterprise recovery
      policy to standardize the reporting and recovery of improper payments. All improper
      payments are deemed collectible and funding is either recovered or is in the
      process of being recovered.'

  2024:
    act17_1: USAC, in conjunction with the FCC, will continue to implement an Improper
      Payment Analysis. Through this process, USAC management performs an analysis
      of its improper payments to understand the root cause and to identify corrective
      actions to mitigate the issues. In collaboration with USAC management, the USAC’s
      Fraud Risk Group has developed a process to evaluate common root causes in an
      effort to identify the true root cause to determine if additional corrective
      action is needed.
    act17_2: The most impactful corrective actions are focused on focused on the robust
      Quality Assurance process to confirm eligibility.  USAC manually reviews appropriate
      documentation to confirm that a consumer is eligible to participate in the Lifeline
      program and is not receiving duplicative support.  The Lifeline Program will
      review the root cause of the errors identified in the assessments and will perform
      updates to training and materials related to the review of eligibility documentation.
    act17_3: During the Risk Management Council Meeting, management will continue
      to review the improper payments and prioritize the largest monetary impact findings
      accordingly. During the meetings, management has an opportunity to discuss effective
      improper payment mitigation strategies. USAC’s Fraud Risk Group has developed
      a process to evaluate common root causes of improper payments in an effort to
      identify the true root cause to determine if additional corrective action is
      needed. This process has enabled USAC management to institutionalize corrective
      actions as part of its program integrity efforts, which will prevent future
      instances of improper payments. USAC leadership is implementing a quarterly
      review process to discuss progress towards executing these corrective actions.
    rnp3: USAC and its manual review vendor have robust Quality Assurance (QA) processes
      in place. Based on the results of the review, the team will perform updates
      to training and materials. In addition, individual coaching is provided to review
      agents for effective error detection. The  QA process has also been used to
      perform a trend analysis. Identifying the trends will provide a proactive approach
      to addressing common errors. The Lifeline Program team will continue to review
      the root cause of the errors identified in the QA process.
