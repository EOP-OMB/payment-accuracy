Actions_By_Year:
  2023:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: "The actions taken by HHS were focused on the causes\
      \ of the improper payments in the UIP because the varied assistance was targeted\
      \ to address the root causes of error identified.  FY 2023 UIP improper payments\
      \ were due to:\n\n•Pricing Errors:  The improper payment estimate due to pricing\
      \ errors (incorrect claims reimbursements due to pricing errors associated with\
      \ HCPCS rates).\n\n•Incorrect Calculation:  The improper payment estimate due\
      \ to incorrect calculation (incorrect claims reimbursements due to the use of\
      \ prior published rates when calculating payments or recalculated amounts not\
      \ reconciling). \n\nAs identified in the previous sections, corrective actions\
      \ are continuously undertaken to diminish deficiencies."
    Mitigation_Strategy: app17_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: HHS continues to prioritize the need to gather historical
      records of policy and program decisions already made into accessible locations.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app4_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Coupled with the historical records, HHS continues to
      work with the UIP contractor to address any data needs and brainstorm methods
      to address these needs, including any data integrity or quality issues.  HHS
      is working with our IT and Security partners as well as the UIP contractor,
      to bring UIP data in-house in a secure manner, which can then be used for various
      requests, audits, and assessments.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app5_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Recipients of the UIP program are subject to review
      as set forth in the UIP Terms and Conditions. HHS conducts reviews of UIP claims
      reimbursement recipients to ensure compliance with applicable legislation and
      the UIP Terms and Conditions and plans to complete 40 UIP assessments by January
      2024.  HHS continues to resolve single and commercial audit findings associated
      with the UIP and recover disallowed costs.

    Mitigation_Strategy: atp17_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: HHS prioritized the need to gather historical records
      of policy and program decisions already made into accessible locations. HHS
      reprocessed claims incorrectly paid due to federal government error, such as
      internal adjudication or payment errors.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp4_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: HHS worked with the UIP contractor to address any data
      needs and brainstormed methods to address these needs, including any data integrity
      or quality issues.  HHS worked with IT and Security partners and the UIP contractor
      to bring UIP data in-house securely to use for various requests, audits, and
      assessments.

    Description_Action_Taken: 'HHS conducted reviews of UIP claims reimbursement recipient
      to ensure compliance with applicable legislation and the UIP Terms and Conditions
      and resolved single and commercial audit findings associated with the UIP and

      recovered disallowed costs.'

Additional_Information_By_Year:
  2023:
    pro1: "UIP is a newly established program and this is the first year of reporting\
      \ and thus HHS is not reporting a RY+1 improper payment plus unknown payment\
      \ reduction target for FY 2024 since FY 2023 was the first year of error rate\
      \ reporting and the program is still establishing a baseline.  UIP anticipates\
      \ establishing a baseline in FY 2024 and reporting a target in the FY 2024 AFR.\
      \  \n\nDespite the requirement to rapidly respond and reimburse providers during\
      \ the height of the pandemic, HHS' commitment to ensuring claims reimbursements\
      \ while striving to establish and maintain sound controls during its $5.4 billion\
      \ in claim reimbursements led to a less than 1% improper payment rate."
