  2022:
    pro1: The US Navy and US Marine Corps Military Pay programs are two examples of
      how the system of internal controls within the Department of the Navy ensure
      that payments totaling over $30 billion annually are calculated and paid correctly
      to service members in support of their service to the Nation.  This reflects
      the Department of the Navy’s commitment to taking care of people.  The extremely
      low improper payment rates, at times 0.00%, also provides Congress and taxpayers
      assurances that funds received and used in payments to our service members are
      legal and proper.  When errors occur, the Department of the Navy has processes
      in place to detect and correct them, and recover overpayments when warranted
      to prevent a loss of federal funds.

    rnp3: 'In FY 2021, the Department of Defense implemented corrective actions which
      consisted of a collaborative timeline process to conduct the PIIA Compliance
      reviews for the Military Pay programs. While the Marine Corps improper payments
      slightly increased, the increase was not significant and not indicative of an
      underlying issue.  The Department of Defense does not anticipate a continuous
      increase of improper and unknown payment amounts in future fiscal years for
      the Marine Corps. In FY 2022, the Department will continue the collaborative
      timeline execution standard to conduct the PIIA Compliance reviews for the Military
      Pay - USMC program. '

    rnp3: 'U.S. Marine Corps (USMC); Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS): With
      the current controls in place for the USMC Military Pay processing, there are
      no potential indicators that would prevent the Marine Corps from continuing
      to accomplish and/or exceed the Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) program
      objectives for the Department of Defense. The continued achievement and success
      that the Marine Corps has duplicated from previous years of Payment Integrity
      results provides projected evidence of the strong internal controls and priority
      within the applications and processes the Marine Corps executes daily in their
      Military Pay program. The implementation and management of the applications
      and processes are a testament to the effectiveness of the USMC Military Pay
      program design. As enhancements and advancements are made to the application
      and processes, the internal control points are addressed to ensure continued
      efficacy from all aspects of USMC Military Pay.'

    cyp15: 'Yes'
    cyp20_2: The reduction target for the US Marine Corps (USMC) Military Pay Program
      is less than the estimated future IP and UP rate. The Department is confident
      that the USMC will achieve the reduction target based on the previous years
      of IP and UP projected results, coupled with their strong internal controls,
      oversight, and due diligence in executing the USMC Military Pay program to ensure
      that US Marines are paid properly for their service.
    rap5: 'Internal Controls:

      The US Marine Corps (USMC) has internal controls in place that support the reduction
      of improper payments in its Military Pay program to the levels the Department
      has targeted.


      Human Capital:

      The USMC has the human capital it needs to reduce improper payments in the Military
      Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted.  However, as the USMC’s
      Military Pay program evolves and DoD operations change, additional skill sets
      and personnel resources may be needed to sustain and advance the program.


      Information Systems and Other Infrastructure:

      The USMC has the information systems and other infrastructure it needs to reduce
      improper payments in the Military Pay program to the Department''s  targeted
      levels.  The USMC uses the Marine Corps Total Force System, which is the integrated
      pay and personnel system for active duty and reserve Marines, and the authoritative
      source of data for all USMC pay and personnel information.'
    rap6: The Department's USMC Military Pay Payment Integrity program did not have
      any Payment Integrity specific recent budget submissions to bring the program
      into compliance with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019.
    rtp4_2: The Department cannot establish an effective tolerable rate until the
      Department can produce reliable Payment Integrity estimates for the programs
      that are currently in Phase II. The DoD OIG concluded that the previous Department
      estimates were unreliable and caused primarily by using an inappropriate variable
      which led to insufficient sample sizes, and incomplete universe of transactions
      (UoT) to pull the Payment Integrity sample population for testing. The Department
      has since implemented several DoD OIG recommendations by performing UoT reconciliations
      for the Payment Integrity Programs to solidify the Sampling and Estimation Plans,
      created a Payment Integrity Risk Appetite Statement to verify the effectiveness
      of the population to create the samples from. Additionally, the Department Payment
      Integrity teams have collaborated and have a specific formula that has been
      approved by the DoD OIG to produce more reliable estimates and sufficient sample
      sizes by testing higher and lower risk payment types accordingly. This new formula
      and process will produce estimates that are more reliable and streamline the
      Department’s efforts to achieve Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) Compliance
      during the FY 2023 Payment Integrity compliance audit. Once the Department has
      DoD OIG confirmed reliable estimates; the Department will be able to establish
      effective and cost beneficial tolerable rates for the Payment Integrity programs.

    Unknown_Curent_Year_Plus_1_Amount: 0.05
    cyp15: 'Yes'
    cyp20_2: The reduction target is significantly below the OMB statutory threshold
      which will initiate the movement of Military Pay - Marine Corps from Phase 2
      in FY 2023 to Phase 1 in FY 2024. Additionally, Military Pay - Marine Corps  movement
      to Phase 1 in FY 2024 is supported by its expected PIIA Compliance rating during
      the FY 2023 PIIA Compliance audit from the DoD OIG, well established baseline
      and the Improper and Unknown payment projection being significantly below the
      OMB statutory threshold.
    rap5: 'Internal Controls:

      The US Marine Corps (USMC) has a robust and highly effective internal controls
      in place that support the continued effectiveness in delivering timely and proper
      payments. These USMC internal controls assist in mitigating the inherent risks
      associated with improper payments within the Department’s Military Pay - Marine
      Corps program.


      Human Capital:

      The USMC has the human capital it needs to reduce improper payments in the Military
      Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted. However, as the USMC’s
      Military Pay program evolves and DoD operations change, additional skill sets,
      and personnel resources may be needed to sustain and advance the program.


      Information Systems and Other Infrastructure:

      The USMC has the information systems and other infrastructure it needs to reduce
      improper payments in the Military Pay program to the Department''s targeted
      levels. The USMC uses the Marine Corps Total Force System, which is the integrated
      pay and personnel system for active duty and reserve Marines, and the authoritative
      source of data for all USMC pay and personnel information.
