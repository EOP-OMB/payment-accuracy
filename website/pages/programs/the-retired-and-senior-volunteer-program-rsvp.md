    rnp3: 'The agency had reductions in improper payments from FY19 to FY20 due to
      agency-wide corrective action for its largest rate driver, NSCHC. The agency
      did see an increase in rates from FY20 to FY21. The agency''s planned corrective
      actions are more aggressive and comprehensive than they have been in the past
      in order to prioritize the reduction of non-NSCHC improper payments and unknown
      payments. The accountable officials and those that own portions of the corrective
      action plan will now meet every other month to assess progress. '

    rnp3: The improper payments reported are made that the grantee level. The improper
      payments are not made at the agency level and largely do not represent monetary
      loss to the government. The majority are unknown payments for which the agency’s
      grantees are unable to provide sufficient support documentation to determine
      if the payment was proper or improper. Since the agency does not have direct
      control over the payments, it is implanting updated, comprehensive trainings
      to ensure the grantees have the requisite knowledge to appropriately support
      their payments. The agency has elevated the reduction of improper payments to
      be a key performance indicator in its strategic plan.

    cyp15: 'Yes'
    cyp20_2: The reduction target equals the estimated future IP and UP rates. The
      agency assumes flat funding for the current year +1 estimate, so the reduction
      target was used to calculate IP and UPs. The corrective actions implemented
      in FY22 that may reduce the future rates are targeting unknown payments, therefore
      that is where the reduction can be seen.
    rap5: As part of its strategic plan, AmeriCorps is prioritizing effective stewardship
      of federal resources. This goal includes the objective of reducing the agency’s
      improper payments via five-pronged approach. Via the strategic plan that agency
      is committing resources – human capital, internal controls, and information
      systems, to reduce improper payments.
    rap6: AmeriCorps did not request resources.
