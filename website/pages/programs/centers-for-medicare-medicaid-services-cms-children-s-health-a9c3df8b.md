      independently verify risk based screening requirements around database checks
      to show that the provider would have been eligible for payment had the state
      maintained documentation to show the screening requirements had been completed
      in accordance with regulations. During eligibility reviews, CMS was able to
      independently verify certain eligibility requirements through review of information
      gathered around separate determinations (i.e., not a Medicaid/CHIP determination)
      for the beneficiary that provided reasonable support that the beneficiary was
      eligible.
