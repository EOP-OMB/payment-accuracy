Actions_By_Year:
  2023:
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: Navy’s Military Pay Program was well below the statutory
      threshold, and did not require a formal corrective action plan.  Navy’s low
      improper payment rate can be attributed to Navy’s system of internal controls
      for pay transactions, which includes up to date policies/procedures, appointments
      of trained personnel, controls over separation of duties to prevent one person
      from having enough authority to process transactions without additional reviews/approval,
      and controls over pre-payment validations to ensure transactions are accurate
      and supported by key supporting documents prior to payment.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp17_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: 'Hence, no specific corrective actions are planned to
      be taken for this program. Furthermore, the Department fully anticipates the
      Military Pay -Navy program to

      automatically move to Phase 1 in FY 2024.'
    Mitigation_Strategy: app17_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: 'The Department''s Military Pay - Navy program did not
      have a formal corrective action plan to maintain or improve based on prior year
      findings. Specifically, Corrective action plans are required under the Payment
      Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) when a program''s total annual improper
      payments plus unknown payments exceed the statutory threshold. In the prior
      reporting year, the

      Military Pay – Navy program reported a total of $1.10 million in improper plus
      unknown payments, which is significantly below the statutory threshold. Hence,
      no specific corrective actions were taken for this program.'

  2022:
    pro1: The US Navy and US Marine Corps Military Pay programs are two examples of
      how the system of internal controls within the Department of the Navy ensure
      that payments totaling over $30 billion annually are calculated and paid correctly
      to service members in support of their service to the Nation.  This reflects
      the Department of the Navy’s commitment to taking care of people.  The extremely
      low improper payment rates, at times 0.00%, also provides Congress and taxpayers
      assurances that funds received and used in payments to our service members are
      legal and proper.  Moreover, then errors occur, the Department of the Navy has
      processes in place to detect and correct errors and recover overpayments when
      warranted as to prevent a loss of federal funds.

      Military Pay program evolves and DoD operations change, additional skill sets
      and personnel resources may be needed to sustain and advance the program.


      Information Systems and Other Infrastructure:

      The Navy has the information systems and other infrastructure it needs to reduce
      improper payments in the Military Pay program to the levels the Department has
      targeted.  However, as technology advances, the Navy and the Department continue

    rap6: The US Navy did not have any specific Payment Integrity requests in its
      recent budget submission.
    rtp4_2: The Department cannot establish an effective tolerable rate until the
      Department can produce reliable Payment Integrity estimates for the programs
      that are currently in Phase II. The DoD Office of Inspector General (OIG) concluded
      that the previous Department estimates were unreliable and caused primarily
      by using an inappropriate variable which led to insufficient sample sizes, and
      incomplete universe of transactions (UoT) to pull the Payment Integrity sample
      population for testing. The Department has since implemented several DoD OIG
      recommendations by performing UoT reconciliations for the Payment Integrity
      Programs to solidify the Sampling and Estimation Plans and creating a Payment
      Integrity Risk Appetite Statement to verify the effectiveness of the population
      to create the samples from. Additionally, the Department Payment Integrity teams
      have collaborated and have a specific formula that has been approved by the
      DoD OIG to produce more reliable estimates and sufficient sample sizes by testing
      higher and lower risk payment types accordingly. This new formula and process
      is anticipated to produce more reliable estimates and streamline the Department’s
      efforts to achieve Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) Compliance during
      the FY 2023 Payment Integrity compliance audit. Once the Department has DoD
      OIG confirmed reliable estimates, the Department will be able to establish effective
      and cost beneficial tolerable rates for the Payment Integrity programs.

      which will initiate the movement of the Military Pay -Navy program from Phase
      2 in FY 2023 to Phase 1 in FY 2024. Additionally, Military Pay - Navy program
      movement to Phase 1 in FY 2024 is supported by its expected PIIA Compliance
      rating during the FY 2023 PIIA Compliance audit from the DoD OIG, its well established
      baseline, and the Improper and Unknown payment projection being significantly
      below the OMB statutory threshold.

    cyp7_ucp4_1: The primary reason the program was unable to conclude whether the
      payments were proper or improper is attributed to missing documents identified
      on the Key Supporting Document Matrix, these documents contain the dollar amount
      needed to fully substantiate the entitlement. The most common documents that
      the applicant failed to provide to substantiate the sampled disbursement were
      missing DD Form 2367, the copy of the lease to support Sailors overseas housing
      allowance (OHA), the split pay option form to support the split pay option (SPO).
      The DD Form 2367 and a copy of lease would validate the member’s OHA rent amount
      and the SPO form would validate the member’s SPO amount. Without those forms,
      the program is unable to conclude whether the payment is proper or improper.
      Additionally, in a few samples, the specific documentation that the command
      was unable to produce was Hazard Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP) Letters. These letters
      should be maintained at the Navy command level and are required to support HDIP
      payments.
    cyp8: An “Unknown Payment” is caused by key supporting documentation (KSD) not
      provided timely to Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Enterprise Audit
      Support team in order to support the entitlement amounts. The KSDs were not
      located in sufficient time for the testing evolution to be completed appropriately.
      The Military Pay - Navy program had a total of 14 out of 2,099 samples that
      were deemed unknown payments due to missing or lack of proper key supporting
      documentation to substantiate the payment. For most instances, the reason the
      program was unable to provide the document requested was due to the sunsetting
      of the previous record repository system (DON Tracker), officially sunset in
      January 2023, making documents no longer accessible.
