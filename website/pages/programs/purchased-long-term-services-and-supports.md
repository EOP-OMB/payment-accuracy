Actions_By_Year:
  2023:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions planned regarding automation include working
      to determine if a system update in the Electronic Claims Adjudication Management
      System is needed to ensure Homemaker/Home Health Aide Service, Community Nursing
      Home, and Veteran Directed Care claims are paid appropriately. VA will then
      develop an effective corrective action for implementation. These actions are
      designed to address overpayments and underpayments attributed to failure to
      access data/information, technically improper payments attributed to statutory
      requirements of program not met, and unknown payments attributed to being unable
      to determine whether proper or improper. Automation was the best mitigation
      strategy because improper and unknown payments resulted from manual processes
      and human error.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app1_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: VA has identified root causes for improper and unknown
      payments and developed effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies.
      The cause of overpayments and underpayments were attributed to failure to access
      data/information, the cause of technically improper payments were attributed
      to statutory requirements of program not met, and the cause of unknown payments
      were attributed to unable to determine whether proper or improper. In particular,
      the majority of overpayments occurred because the claim was not paid according
      to contract terms. The majority of underpayments occurred because the payment
      was made for less than what was billed on the claim. The majority of technically
      improper payments occurred because VA placed contract orders for Community Nursing
      Home care without the proper authority in place. The majority of unknown payments
      occurred because the provider status is not current with the Center for Medicare
      and Medicaid Services for the dates of service to validate the appropriate pricing.
      Automation was the best mitigation strategy because improper and unknown payments
      resulted from manual processes and human error. Change process was the best
      mitigation strategy in order to develop stronger internal controls and mitigate
      risks within existing payment processes.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app17_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions taken regarding automation to address overpayments
      and underpayments included moving all future purchased care to be processed
      through the Electronic Claims Adjudication Management System or by third party
      administrators. This will ensure correct authorization, amount of care, and
      correct rate. These actions were taken to address overpayments and underpayments
      attributed to failure to access data/information. Although the overall corrective
      actions were not fully implemented/completed during FY 2023 for actions addressing
      underpayments, tasks within the actions were completed to move the overall action
      implementation forward.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp1_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions planned regarding change process include working
      to ensure invoices are being validated per the contract pricing prior to payment.
      VA will also implement short and long-term contracting options for Community
      Nursing Home payments to improve compliance with procurement requirements. In
      addition, VA will enforce contract requirements for third party administrators
      to bill at the correct allowable rates. These actions are designed to address
      overpayments and underpayments attributed to failure to access data/information,
      technically improper payments attributed to statutory requirements of program
      not met, and unknown payments attributed to being unable to determine whether
      proper or improper. Change process was the best mitigation strategy in order
      to develop stronger internal controls and mitigate risks within existing payment
      processes.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app4_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: VA has identified root causes of improper and unknown
      payments and developed effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies.
      The cause of overpayments and underpayments were attributed to failure to access
      data/information, the cause of technically improper payments were attributed
      to statutory requirements of the program not met, and the cause of unknown payments
      were attributed to unable to determine whether proper or improper. In particular,
      the majority of overpayments occurred because claims and payments exceeded the
      level of care authorized for the billed dates of service and were not validated
      prior to payment. The majority of underpayments occurred because the claim was
      not paid according to the VA fee schedule. The majority of technically improper
      payments occurred because a valid Choice Provider Agreement was not in place
      for non-contract services on the date the care was provided. The majority of
      unknown payments occurred because VA was missing information on the authorization
      document to be able to verify the services were authorized or required contract
      information exists. Automation was the best mitigation strategy because overpayments
      resulted from manual processes and human error. Change process was the best
      mitigation strategy in order to develop stronger internal controls and mitigate
      risks within existing payment processes.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp17_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions taken regarding change process included monitoring
      errors related to the legacy community care system, which were considered timing
      issues, and should no longer occur with the implementation of the MISSION Act.
      Additionally, VA simplified the documentation request process and utilized tools
      that targeted missing documentation. These actions were taken to address technically
      improper payments attributed to statutory requirements of the program not met
      and unknown payments attributed to being unable to determine whether proper
      or improper.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp4_1
  2024:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions planned include updating the claims processing
      system to pay Bowel and Bladder and Community Nursing Home claims appropriately.
      These actions are designed to reduce underpayments attributed to failure to
      access data/information and technically improper payments attributed to statutory
      requirements of the program were not met. Automation was the best mitigation
      strategy because improper payments resulted from manual processes and human
      error.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app1_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions planned include working internally with facilities
      to provide education and training to resolve missing documentation errors related
      to authorization, payment or Veteran level of care to support the payment process.
      These actions are designed to reduce unknown payments attributed to being unable
      to determine whether proper or improper. Training was the best mitigation strategy
      to communicate the importance of consistencies in standard operating procedures.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app3_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions planned include moving to a standardized rate
      schedule for Community Nursing Home payments in order to transition payments
      from a legacy system to an automated claims adjudication system. Additionally,
      VA will continue clarifing payment methodology with third-party administrators
      to bill at the correct rates, and will implement short and long term contracting
      options for Community Nursing Home payments to improve compliance with procurement
      requirements. In addition, VA will resolve contracting requirements involving
      missing signatures and inability to reconcile procurement vendor to invoice
      vendor, and will work to establish Veterans Care Agreements when appropriate.
      These actions are designed to address overpayments attributed to failure to
      access data/information, technically improper payments attributed to statutory
      requirements of the program not met, and unknown payments attributed to being
      unable to determine whether proper or improper. Change process was the best
      mitigation strategy in order to develop stronger internal controls and mitigate
      risks within existing payment processes.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app4_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions taken included updating the claims processing
      system to pay or deny Homemaker/Home Health Aid Service, Community Nursing Home,
      and Veteran Directed Care claims appropriately. These actions were taken to
      address overpayments attributed to failure to access data/information, technically
      improper payments attributed to statutory requirements of program not met, and
      unknown payments attributed to being unable to determine whether proper or improper.
      Although the overall corrective actions were not fully implemented/completed
      during FY 2024, tasks within the actions were completed to move the overall
      action implementation forward. Automation was the best mitigation strategy because
      improper and unknown payments resulted from manual processes and human error.

      Home payments to improve compliance with procurement requirements. Finally,
      VA clarified payment methodology with third-party administrators to bill at
      the correct rates. These actions were taken to address overpayments and underpayments
      attributed to failure to access data/information, technically improper payments
      attributed to statutory requirements of the program not met, and unknown payments
      attributed to being unable to determine whether proper or improper. Although

  2022:
    pro1: The Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program continues to prioritize
      and implement effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce
      improper and unknown payments as evidenced by its second consecutive year of
      reductions. Specifically, from FY 2021 to FY 2022, the Purchased Long Term Services
      and Supports program decreased its improper and unknown error rate from 72.80%
      to 47.45% (25.35% reduction) and improper and unknown payments from $1,895.27
      million to $1,285.50 million ($609.77 million reduction).
    rnp4: null
  2023:
    pro1: The Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program continues to prioritize
      and implement effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce
      improper and unknown payments as evidenced by its third consecutive year of
      reductions. Specifically, from FY 2022 to FY 2023, the Purchased Long Term Services
      and Supports program decreased its improper and unknown error rate from 47.45%
      to 38.72% (8.73% reduction). Due to needs and increased costs, the program did
      see an increase in outlays of 35.18%; therefore, although the program did successfully
      reduce its rate of improper and unknown payments, its overall reported improper
      and unknown payments increased. Given the time it takes to implement corrective
      actions and mitigation strategies, the program expects the continued positive
      impact of these actions on its FY 2024 improper and unknown payment rate.
    rnp4: null
  2024:
    pro1: The Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program continues to prioritize
      and implement effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce
      improper and unknown payments as evidenced by its fourth consecutive year of
      reductions. Specifically, from FY 2023 to FY 2024, the Purchased Long Term Services
      and Supports program decreased its improper and unknown error rate from 38.72%
      to 13.52% (25.20% reduction) and improper and unknown payments from $1.42 billion
      to $760.09 million ($657.90 million reduction). Given the time it takes to implement
      corrective actions and mitigation strategies, the program expects the continued
      positive impact of these actions on its FY 2025 improper and unknown payment
      rate.
    rnp4: This program was determined noncompliant in FY 2024 by the Office of Inspector
      General and reported improper and unknown payments above required thresholds
      for a compliance determination in FY 2025. In FY 2025, VA executive managers
      and program personnel will be focused on prevention and recovery of overpayments
      as appropriate. This will include various mitigation strategies such as automation,
      change process, and training. These actions address the root causes of errors
      found in FY 2024 payment integrity testing. VA’s executive managers to include
      the Deputy Executive Director for Geriatrics and Extended Care and program personnel
      will be held accountable through annual performance criteria contained within
      their performance plans. Performance criteria will be unique to and inclusive
      of all their duties. Depending on each employees’ responsibilities, duties can
      include preventing improper and unknown payments through effective internal
      controls, recovering overpayments if appropriate, and implementing remediation
      efforts for known causes of improper and unknown payments. State and local governments
      are not involved in the execution of this program.

    rnp3: VA continues to prioritize and implement effective corrective actions and
      mitigation strategies that reduce improper payments agency-wide as evidenced
      by its third consecutive and largest year of reductions. Specifically, from
      FY20 to FY21, the Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program decreased
      its error rate from 95.34 percent to 72.80 percent (22.54% reduction) and improper
      payments from $2,547.91 million to $1,895.26 million ($652.65 million reduction).
      Due to PLTSS reporting over $100 million of overpayments/monetary loss in FY
      2021, PLTSS will begin reporting as a high priority program in FY 2022.

    rnp3: 'VA performed an effectiveness review in FY 2022 of the actions implemented
      in FY 2021.  The purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness of
      corrective actions and mitigation strategies and whether the actions were effectively
      implemented and prioritized within the agency. The results for the Purchased
      Long Term Services and Supports program indicated that of the five  actions
      assessed, one was closed and determined to be effective in mitigating the root
      cause, one was closed and determined to be ineffective in mitigating the root
      cause, two were open and determined to be correctly designed to mitigate the
      root cause, and one was open and determined that improvements could be made
      to effectively mitigate the root cause. If improvements could be made, VA conducted
      a root cause analysis to refine the program''s mitigation strategies to ensure
      they address and reduce root cause(s) of error.


      For errors tied to failure to access data/information, associated corrective
      actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a total reduction in the improper
      payment amount from $158.38 million in FY 2020 to $74.79 million in FY 2021,
      or a 53% reduction. For errors tied to statutory requirements of program were
      not met, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies contributed
      to a total reduction in the improper payment amount from $2,131.72 million in
      FY 2020 to $912.36 million in FY 2021, or a 57% reduction. For errors tied to
      unable to determine whether proper or improper, associated corrective actions
      or mitigation strategies did not reduce the unknown payment amount from FY 2020
      to FY 2021.


      VA will perform an effectiveness review in FY 2023 of the corrective action
      plans implemented in FY 2022 due to the time needed to implement actions as
      well as to impact the payment process. Results of this review will be reported

      review will be reported in FY 2024.'
  2024:
    act17_1: VA has identified root causes of improper and unknown payments and developed
      effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies. The cause of FY 2024
      overpayments and underpayments were attributed to failure to access data/information,
      the cause of technically improper payments were attributed to statutory requirements
      of the program not met, and the cause of unknown payments were attributed to
      unable to determine whether proper or improper. In particular, the majority
      of overpayments occurred because claims were not paid according to the contracted
      rates. The majority of underpayments occurred because a payment system error
      resulted in the payment being made in an amount less than the contract or agreement
      rate. The majority of technically improper payments occurred because a purchase
      was made without a contract utilizing a Basic Ordering Agreement, which is not
      a contract. The majority of unknown payments occurred because VA was missing
      documentation such as a valid consultation or missing information on the claim
      document to be able to verify substantially all clean claim requirements were
      met per the contract or agreement. Automation was the best mitigation strategy
      because improper payments resulted from manual processes and human error. Change
      process was the best mitigation strategy in order to develop stronger internal
      controls and mitigate risks within existing payment processes. Training was
      the best mitigation strategy to communicate the importance of consistencies
      in standard operating procedures.
    act17_2: VA reduced the error rate in this program from 38.72% in FY 2023 to 13.52%
      in FY 2024, resulting in a reduction of $657.90 million, by implementing effective
      corrective actions and mitigation strategies. VA's process for development of
      corrective actions and mitigation strategies ensures the severity of the error
      is considered and the action is adequate. VA's corrective actions and mitigation
      strategies have been evaluated by the Office of Inspector General during their
      FY 2024 annual audit and determined reasonable with no recommendations for improvement.
      The overpayments and underpayments were attributed to failure to access data/information,
      technically improper payments were attributed to statutory requirements of the
      program not met, and unknown payments were attributed to being unable to determine
      whether proper or improper. Actions taken regarding automation included updating
      the claims processing system to pay or deny Homemaker/Home Health Aid Service,
      Community Nursing Home, and Veteran Directed Care claims appropriately. Actions
      planned regarding automation include updating the claims processing system to
      pay Bowel and Bladder and Community Nursing Home claims appropriately. Actions
      taken regarding change process include working to ensure invoices are being
      validated per the contract pricing prior to payment. Additionally, VA worked
      to implement short and long term contracting options for Community Nursing Home
      payments to improve compliance with procurement requirements. Finally, VA clarified
      payment methodology with third-party administrators to bill at the correct rates.
      Actions planned regarding change process include moving to a standardized rate
      schedule for Community Nursing Home payments in order to transition from a legacy
      system to an automated claims adjudication system. Additionally, VA will continue
      clarifying payment methodology with third-party administrators to bill at the
      correct allowable rates, and will work to implement short- and long-term contracting
      options for Community Nursing Home payments to improve compliance with procurement
      requirements. Further, VA will resolve contracting requirements involving missing
      signatures and inability to reconcile procurement vendor to invoice vendor,
      and will establish Veterans Care Agreements when appropriate. Actions planned
      regarding training include working internally with facilities to provide education
      and training to resolve missing documentation related to authorization, payment
      or Veteran level of care to support the payment process.
    act17_3: VA updates corrective action plans annually based on testing results,
      and no less than quarterly throughout the fiscal year, to ensure actions planned
      are appropriately prioritized and designed to mitigate risks of improper and
      unknown payments. VA monitors progress and results of implementation on a quarterly
      basis. Additionally, an effectiveness review is performed annually to measure
      if an action has reduced or is properly designed to reduce improper and unknown
      payments for a specific root cause based on a set benchmark. The annual effectiveness
      review process allows VA to create or update actions as necessary to ensure
      continued progress in the remediation of improper and unknown payments. If areas
      for improvement were identified, VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine
      the program's mitigation strategies to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s)
      of error. The decrease in the improper payment and unknown payment rate from
      38.72% in FY 2023 to 13.52% in FY 2024 and the $657.90 million reduction in
      improper and unknown payments supports the effective implementation and prioritization
      of action within the agency.

    cyp20_2: The Purchased Long Term Services and Supports reduction target is equal
      to the estimated future improper payment and unknown payment rate. VA establishes
      reduction targets by setting them lower than the current year improper payment
      estimates.  Reduction targets are a balance between being aggressive and realistic.
      One thing VA has learned from the many years it has been working to comply with
      improper payments legislation is that it can take three years from the point
      an error cause is isolated during testing to develop a corrective action, implement
      it, and then wait for payments to be made that can then be tested the following
      year since VA tests and reports improper payments one year in arrears.
    rap5: VA has not yet determined the tolerable rate. VA is working to determine

    rap6: VA is still working to determine all requirements for establishing a tolerable
      rate per Office of Management and Budget guidance before attempting to establish
      a tolerable rate.  At this time, VA is not aware of additional program needs.
    rtp4_2: VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
      a tolerable rate not yet being met. VA continues to prioritize implementing
      appropriate corrective actions and mitigation strategies to reduce improper
      and unknown payments. The program plans to be compliant with the Payment Integrity
      Information Act of 2019 by for FY 2024.

      reduction targets by setting them lower than the current year improper payment
      estimates.  Reduction targets are a balance between being aggressive and realistic.
      One thing VA has learned from the many years it has been working to comply with
      improper payments legislation is that it can take three years from the point
      an error cause is isolated during testing to develop a corrective action, implement
      it, and then wait for payments to be made that can then be tested the following
      year since VA tests and reports improper payments one year in arrears.
    rap5: 'VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing

      reduction in improper and unknown payments using effective mitigation strategies
      and corrective actions (GAO-23-106285, IMPROPER PAYMENTS: Fiscal Year 2022 Estimates
      and Opportunities for Improvement). VA continues to prioritize implementing

      to implement improvements planned to internal controls, human capital, information
      systems and other infrastructure, as needed, over VA’s payment processing and
      procurement systems to continue reducing improper and unknown payments. VA will
      establish a tolerable rate if all applicable requirements are met.'

    cyp8: The payments are considered unknown payments when VA had lacking or insufficient
      documentation to validate the appropriate contract or agreement pricing. Specifically,
      the agency was unable to determine the appropriate pricing due to the lack of
      provider status in the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services covering the

    cyp8: The payments are considered unknown payments when VA had missing or insufficient
      documentation to validate that clean claim requirements were met per the contract
      or agreement. Specifically, the claim was missing key elements that are required

      documentation to validate the appropriate consultation, claim documentation,
      or documentation supporting the billed level of care to confirm the appropriate
      payment amount. Without documentation supporting the required claim elements,
      the program is unable to determine whether the amount paid is proper or improper.
