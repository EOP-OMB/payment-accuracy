    pro1: "The Coast Guard ALC provides centralized logistics support for all Coast\
      \ Guard aviation missions. ALC's mission supports 26 Coast Guard aviation units\
      \ that operate approximately 200 aircraft with air stations located throughout\
      \ the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. In addition,\
      \ ALC supports deployed aircraft worldwide. USCG receipt of Disaster Supplemental\
      \ Funding addresses operational response costs as well as reconstitution costs\
      \ for damage to Coast Guard aviation assets and equipment due to Hurricanes\
      \ Harvey, Irma, and Maria.\n\nFor the testing conducted in 2021, USCG’s assessment\
      \ was focused on the associated FY 2019 disaster supplemental funding disbursements\
      \ of over $16 million applicable for review under PIIA. For additional information\
      \ on the results of this assessment, please refer to the FY 2021 published data\
      \ on paymentaccuracy.gov. \n\nA second year of consecutive testing has been\
      \ conducted for the United States Coast Guard (USCG) - Aviation Logistics Command\
      \ - Disaster Supplemental Funds program with results remaining below the OMB\
      \ Circular A-123, Appendix C guidance threshold to be considered susceptible\
      \ to significant improper payments. DHS has determined that the program has\
      \ been baselined and has converted the program back to Phase 1 for FY 2023 reporting\
      \ based on the quantitative results of the testing."

    rap5: Program is reflective of disaster supplemental funding that was received
      by DHS to respond to the Hurricane Harvey, Irma, and Maria disasters that occurred
      in the 2017 / 2018 timeframe. Due to the burden of testing and reporting, Disaster
      Supplemental Funding programs are tested and reported two years in arrears.
      As such, by the time that remedial action is taken and/or is realized in the
      PIIA testing results, the total value of annual disbursements is expected to
      be below the threshold for PIIA action. DHS will continue to make process and
      internal control improvements to improve the payment management processes as
      it relates to supplemental funding but feels that internal control, human capital,
      information system, and infrastructure needs have been met.

    cyp20_2: For statistical testing performed over the FY 2019 and FY 2020 disbursements
      made by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) – Aviation Logistics Command –
      Disaster Supplemental Funds program, no improper payments have been identified.
      As such, DHS has published the reduction target at the same 0.00%. However,
      based on the two consecutive years of testing results and the fact that DHS
      considers the program baselined, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) – Aviation
      Logistics Command– Disaster Supplemental Funds program will be converted back
      to Phase 1, in accordance with OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C guidance, for
      the FY 2023 reporting.
    rap5: DHS has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human capital
      and information system and other infrastructure to reduce improper payments
      and unknown payments to the tolerable rate for the United States Coast Guard
      (USCG) – Aviation Logistics Command – Disaster Supplemental Funds program.
    rap6: "N/A - DHS did not request additional resources in the most recent budget\
      \ submission of the agency. \n\nBased on the historical testing results that\
      \ have been published, the internal controls and resources within the United\
      \ States Coast Guard (USCG) – Aviation Logistics Command – Disaster Supplemental\
      \ Funds program have been and remain sufficient to reduce and prevent improper\
      \ payments and unknown payments to a tolerable level."
