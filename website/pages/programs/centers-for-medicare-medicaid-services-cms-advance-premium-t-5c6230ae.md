Actions_By_Year:
  2023:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: HHS’s corrective actions include identifying and remediating
      system defects within the Exchanges that may impact APTC payments.  These defects
      become known through various mechanisms, including internal quality control
      activities and external reviews of APTC eligibility determinations made by the
      Exchanges. HHS continually evaluates the policies and procedures that underlie
      the automated processes associated with APTC to identify and address weaknesses
      that may surface as they become operationalized.  HHS also proactively improves
      its automated processes, e.g., the Verify Lawful Presence service with the Department
      of Homeland Security was upgraded to ensure more accurate and timely lawful
      presence verifications. HHS implemented process automation to reduce human error
      introduced during adjudication and processing of supporting documentation.  HHS
      will continue to encourage and require that additional tasks be automated to
      further reduce manual errors and improve the accuracy and quality of required
      adjudication tasks. HHS plans to continue these actions in FY 2024, but will
      not finalize this decision until the APTC Error Rate data analysis is complete.

  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: "HHS developed effective corrective actions and mitigation\
      \ strategies that are focused on identified root causes for improper payments\
      \ and plans to continue these actions in FY 2024.  The payments that fall into\
      \ the overpayment category are largely related to manual administrative errors\
      \ and process errors. In particular the majority of overpayments occurred because\
      \ of system defects within the Exchanges that may impact APTC payments. Corrective\
      \ actions focused on identifying and remediating system defects are the best\
      \ mitigation strategy since they are closely aligned with the largest drivers\
      \ of the error rate. In addition to remediating system defects, HHS also plans\
      \ to use staff training, audits, and risk models to address the root causes\
      \ of improper payments in FY 2024. \n\n"

  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: As part of Eligibility Support Contractor Education,
      personnel undergo thorough onboarding training, annual refreshers, and quick
      lessons for policy or operations updates. Ad- hoc training is provided as needed.
      HHS conducts extra training sessions for Data Matching Issues verifications,
      casework, and outreach. HHS plans to continue these actions in FY 2024, but
      will not finalize this decision until the APTC Error Rate data analysis is complete.

    Description_Action_Taken: Both the automated and the manual processes of the Exchanges
      are subject to rigorous annual testing of key internal controls as required
      by Appendix C of OMB Circular A-123.  External audits by OIG and GAO are another
      common mechanism that help to identify potential payment integrity risks within
      the Exchanges, specifically by evaluating APTC eligibility determinations made
      by the Exchanges within the context of federal statute and regulations. HHS
      plans to continue these actions in FY 2024, but will not finalize this decision
      until the APTC Error Rate data analysis is complete.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app6_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: The Marketplace Program Integrity Contractor implemented
      a risk model that incorporates many risk factors that may indicate potential
      fraud or misconduct by agents or brokers.  The result is a risk profile and
      weighted risk score for each agent or broker.  Those that pose the highest risk,
      based on weighted risk score, are prioritized for investigations.  The risk
      profile is also leveraged as part of a prioritized investigation and significant
      discoveries may be used to inform interview questions or as supporting evidence
      in overall case findings. In FY23, there are 23 indicators in the A/B risk model.

Additional_Information_By_Year:
  2022:
    pro1: This year marks the first time CMS has measured the improper payment rate
      for the Federally-facilitated Exchange (FFE) program. CMS estimated the improper
      payment rate based on a review of a stratified random sample of applications
      to determine if the FFE properly performed the required eligibility determinations
      and paid the appropriate benefits for each sampled application. The FFE improper
      payment estimate does not reflect payments made by State-based Exchanges (SBEs).
      CMS continues to develop the SBEs improper payment measurement methodology and
      will continue to provide updates on the development status through its annual
      Agency Financial Report.
    rnp4: null
  2023:
    pro1: "The Reporting Year (RY) 2023 Federally-facilitated Exchange improper payment\
      \ rate is statistically similar to the RY 2022 Federally-facilitated Exchange\
      \ improper payment rate. \n\nCMS is committed to strengthening and maintaining\
      \ program integrity efforts to reduce improper payments rates. Key corrective\
      \ actions include identifying and fixing system defects within the Exchanges,\
      \ training and education for Exchanges peronnel through the use of the Eligibility\
      \ Support Contractor, and rigorous annual testing of internal controls for the\
      \ Exchanges. CMS has also developed a risk model to assess agents' and brokers'\
      \ potential fraud or misconduct. This model calculates a risk score for each\
      \ agent or broker based on various risk factors. Agents or brokers with the\
      \ highest risk scores are investigated first."
    rnp4: null
  2024:
    pro1: The Reporting Year (RY) 2024 Federally-facilitated Exchange improper payment
      rate is statistically similar to the RY 2023 Federally-facilitated Exchange
      improper payment rate.
    rnp4: HHS reports the agency’s improper payment targets annually in the AFR. In
      addition, HHS sets annual Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) goals
      tied to reducing the improper payments. HHS executive officials are held accountable
      for assessing improper payment rates and taking meaningful steps to address
      the root causes of error. These efforts are reflected in each executive’s performance
      plan, as appropriate. HHS also reports quarterly on the specific actions taken
      to address the improper payment rates through the quarterly scorecard process
      for high-priority programs, providing a level of public oversight over these
      efforts.

  2024:
    act17_1: HHS developed effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies
      that are focused on identified root causes for improper payments and plans to
      continue these actions in FY 2024.  The payments that fall into the overpayment
      category are largely related to manual administrative errors and process errors.
      In particular the majority of overpayments occurred because of system defects
      within the Exchanges that may impact APTC payments. Corrective actions focused
      on identifying and remediating system defects are the best mitigation strategy
      since they are closely aligned with the largest drivers of the error rate. In
      addition to remediating system defects, HHS also plans to use staff training,
      audits, and risk models to address the root causes of improper payments in FY
      2025.
    act17_2: HHS’s corrective actions largely focus on identifying and remediating
      system defects within the Exchanges that may impact APTC payments. In FY 2024,
      HHS continued to remediate system defects, conduct trainings, conduct audits,
      and used risk models to address the root causes of overpayments. These actions
      led to an error rate of 1.01%. HHS plans to continue these actions in FY 2025
      in order to further reduce the error rate.
    act17_3: The planned and completed actions provide a number of corrective action

    cyp6_1: The technically improper payments identified under the Exchange Improper
      Payment Measurement  (EIPM) program are the improper payments that are recognized
      when a legally applicable requirement related to payment conditions is not satisfied
      by the Exchange, however, there was no impact on the total advance premium tax
      credit.  Per 45 CFR §155.330 (d), the Federally-facilitated Exchange must periodically
      examine available data sources to identify changes in death, Medicare, Medicaid,
      and CHIP. In this scenario, the Federally-facilitated Exchange conducted periodic
      data match checks against the Social Security Administration for death data
      during the benefit year.  A large volume of periodic data match checks occurring
      simultaneously caused the technical limitation which prevented the generation
      of the Death Periodic Data Matching verification request for an enrollee   As
      a result of an enrollee was omitted from the batch in error.

    cyp6_1: The technically improper payments identified under the EIPM program are
      the improper payments that are recognized when a legally applicable requirement
      related to payment conditions is not satisfied by the Exchange, however, there
      was no impact on the total advance premium tax credit.  The cause of the Technically
      Improper payments was due to the Federally Facilitated Exchange failing to conduct
      periodic verifications of consumer eligibility due to technical problems interacting
      with trusted data sources.
