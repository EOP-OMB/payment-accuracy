Actions_By_Year:
  2023:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Response not applicable because the Title I, Part A
      program’s IP and UP estimate is below the statutory threshold.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app17_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: These were accounting errors that resulted in rounding
      errors made by the recipient of the funds. The small amounts identified relative
      to the program outlays would not usually present an opportunity to efficiently
      use resources to attempt to recover.

  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: The Department has worked internally to address accounting
      errors that resulted in rounding errors made by the recipients of the funds.
      The small amounts identified relative to the program outlays would not usually

  2023:
    pro1: "Unknown Payments (UPs) were the primary driver of this program’s high estimated\
      \ Improper Payment (IP) and Unknown Payment (UP) rate reported in FY22. The\
      \ UPs identified in FY22 were the result of lack of documentation due to the\
      \ delayed start of the study and the payment recipients not understanding what\
      \ type of supporting documentation to provide to satisfy the requirements of\
      \ the study. \n\nThe Department implemented effective mitigation strategies\
      \ in FY23 which resulted in the elimination of UPs, and subsequently the significant\
      \ reduction of the estimated IP and UP rate in FY23. The strategies implemented\
      \ are as follows:  \n\nThe Department began the FY23 study earlier in the fiscal\
      \ year, providing sufficient time for State Education Agencies (SEAs) to obtain\
      \ and provide supporting documentation from Local Education Agencies (LEAs)\
      \ for the program’s payments. \n\nThe Department also provided SEAs with targeted\
      \ technical assistance and training. This assistance encompassed technical assistance\
      \ meetings with certain states, written guidance, and payment documentation\
      \ criteria guidance. \n\nAdditionally, The Department formally issued its policy\
      \ on Payment Integrity, providing guidance to agency employees, in Fiscal Year\
      \ 2023."

    rnp3: The Department relies on its robust internal control framework and continues
      to address gaps, strengthen internal control processes, and align assessments
      with enterprise risk management. All of these efforts reflect the Department’s

    rnp3: The Title I, Part A Grants to Local Educational Agencies program concluded
      its second year of reporting in FY 2022. However, the program's sampling and
      estimation methodology plan was revised in FY 2022. While the baseline for the
      program has not been established and the tolerable rate has not been identified,
      the program has taken steps to address the unknown payments identified at the
      conclusion of the study. For each unknown payment sample in the study, the responsible
      program office will provide a written determination whether the payment was
      proper or improper. The program offices will communicate to their subprogram
      grantees regarding obtaining and/or providing supporting documentation to the
      Department, as part of its efforts to comply with PIIA. Messaging to grantees
      will include establishing expectations by providing grantees with background
      on PIIA, the anticipated timeline, the importance of being attentive and responsive
      to the payment integrity team’s communications and requests, and the type of
      documentation requested under the Fiscal Year 2023 methodology to substantiate
      sampled payments.
