Actions_By_Year:
  2023:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: HHS's planned actions for the Head Start program are
      focused on the causes of the improper and unknown payments because they are
      developed based on the specific error causes identified during the payment integrity
      reviews.  The actions will provide targeted assistance to recipients to ensure
      they understand what led to the errors and provide training to reduce the likelihood
      of occurrence in the future.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app17_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: HHS plans to provide ongoing training to recipients
      on the issues that caused payment errors in the Head Start program.  Training
      will be conducted in areas such as procurement, source documentation, cost allocation,
      allowability of cost and other common fiscal challenges that lead to payment
      errors.  HHS also plans to issue Information Memorandum and Program Instructions
      as needed to ensure fiscal and program integrity.    In addition, targeted technical
      assistance will be provided to individual recipients to address their specific
      error causes.  Further, HHS plans to take recovery action on payment errors
      identified during improper payment reviews and continue to issue disallowances
      on errors discovered through HHS Office of Inspector General audits, HHS program
      reviews, and Single Audits.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app3_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: The actions taken by HHS were focused on the cause of
      the Improper Payments and Unknown Payments in the Head Start program because
      the actions were based on the specific causes of the errors identified during
      the review.  As errors were identified, the issue was raised with the recipient.  Depending
      on factors such as frequency of occurrence of an error, HHS engaged in targeted
      technical assistance with the Head Start recipient to address the root cause
      of the error.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp17_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: Errors are primarily attributed to failing to adhere
      to the statutory requirements of the Head Start program.  The training corrective
      actions taken by HHS include working with grant recipients in areas such as
      procurement, source documentation, cost allocation, allowability of cost and
      other common fiscal challenges that lead to payment errors.  HHS also enhanced
      the Head Start monitoring tool to include transaction reviews.

  2024:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: HHS plans to provide ongoing training to Head Start
      funding recipients on the issues that caused payment errors in the Head Start
      program. Training will be conducted in areas such as procurement, source documentation,
      cost allocation, allowability of cost and other common fiscal challenges that
      lead to payment errors. HHS also plans to conduct improper payment training
      to ensure Head Start funding recipients and sub-recipients understand the purposes,
      processes, and expectations around payment integrity.  In addition, HHS plans
      to conduct training specific to financial record keeping, sharing comprehensive
      and practical approaches to financial records management.

  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: HHS Change Process corrective actions planned include
      engaging expert consultant services to assess approaches to support Head Start
      funding recipients' processes and HHS internal oversight procedures in the Head
      Start program.  HHS also plans to issue sub-regulatory guidance to clarify fiscal
      and operational requirements of the Head Start program.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app4_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: HHS will continue to utilize audits as a corrective
      action in the Head Start program. HHS will continue to review Head Start funding
      recipients' transactions to determine if expenditures are properly supported.  HHS
      will take recovery actions on payment errors identified through improper payment
      reviews and audits by the HHS Office of Inspector General, program reviews,
      and Single Audits.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app6_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: HHS plans to utilize Predictive Analytics as a corrective
      action in the Head Start program.  HHS will leverage modern technologies to
      support Head Start funding recipients by monitoring  aspects of recipient financial
      performance and alerting HHS when a recipient may be moving towards non-compliance
      with policies and procedures.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app7_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: The training corrective actions taken by HHS included
      working with Head Start funding recipients to provide training through the Regional
      Technical Assistance Networks and National Centers.  The training was in areas
      such as procurement, source documentation, cost allocation, allowability of
      cost and other common fiscal challenges that lead to payment errors.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp3_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: The change process corrective action taken by HHS was
      to enhance its oversight to include transaction reviews of Head Start funding
      recipients.  This enhanced oversight resulted in process changes or targeted
      training where needed based on deficiencies and weaknesses found during the
      Head Start funding recipients' transaction reviews.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp4_1
Additional_Information_By_Year:
  2021:
    pro1: null
    rnp4: null
  2022:
    pro1: Head Start was determined to be risk-susceptible in FY 2021. As with other
      programs, developing and implementing a new improper payment estimation methodology
      and process can be a time-intensive process.  HHS is developing an improper
      payment measurement and expects to report an error rate for this program in
      FY 2023.
    rnp4: null
  2023:
    pro1: HHS annually awards over $10 billion in federal grants to approximately
      2,100 funding recipients for the Head Start program.  HHS is committed to ensuring
      the most vulnerable families benefit from enrollment in the Head Start program.  To
      accomplish this, HHS strives to identify strategies to strengthen our monitoring
      and oversight of the Head Start program to ensure that funds are used for their
      intended and allowable purposes.
    rnp4: null
  2024:
    pro1: HHS annually awards over $10 billion in federal grants to approximately
      2,100 funding recipients for the Head Start program. HHS is committed to ensuring
      the most vulnerable families benefit from enrollment in the Head Start program.
      To accomplish this, HHS strives to identify strategies to strengthen our monitoring
      and oversight of the Head Start program to ensure that funds are used for their
      intended and allowable purposes. Based on our planned corrective actions, we
      do not expect the rate to be over 10% for the Head Start program in FY 2025.  HHS
      is putting a number of mitigation strategies in place to support stronger internal
      processes to support this goal, including securing consultant services to conduct
      a review of current processes, enhancing training and technical assistance for
      grantees, and strengthening current oversight. Since the Improper Payments and
      Unknown Payments error rate for the Head Start program is based on a one-year
      look back, HHS believes that the corrective actions implemented in FY 2024 will
      be reflected in the FY 2025 results.
    rnp4: HHS evaluates its processes and controls each year in accordance with the
      requirements of the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-123, Management’s
      Responsibility for Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Controls, which includes
      Appendix C, Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement. As part of this
      annual assessment, HHS requires its offices to complete an Internal Control
      and Risk Management Certification that is signed by a senior member of the applicable
      office. Further, the HHS Operating Division prepares an assurance statement
      which represents the HHS Operating Division head's informed judgement as to
      the overall adequacy and effectiveness of Internal controls within the HHS Operating
      Division related to operations, reporting, and compliance. In addition, non-federal
      entities that receive federal funds, including states, local governments, tribes,
      and non-profit organizations, are subject to audit requirements under the Single
      Audit Act of 1984, as amended in 1996. The implementing guidance, Uniform Administrative
      Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, that
      was in effect during 2023, required Single Audits for nonfederal entities that
      expend $750,000 or more in federal awards during the nonfederal entity’s fiscal
      year. With the Office of Management and Budget's April 2024 released revisions
      to the Uniform Guidance, the threshold increases to $1,000,000 effective October
      01, 2024. In addition to the improper payment error rate calculation activities,
      overpayments are identified and recovered through Single Audits and HHS Office
      of Inspector General audits. Foreach of the aforementioned activities, recipients
      are subject to disallowances for any expenditures not made in accordance with
      program regulations.

    rnp3: HHS's planned and completed actions address the causes of the Improper Payments
      and Unknown Payments because they focus on the specific errors identified during
      the review.  Targeted technical assistance is provided to address the underlying
      causes of the errors, along with follow-up action to ensure that corrective
      action was taken to address the root cause of the Improper Payments and Unknown
      Payments in the Head Start program.  Based on our initial assessment, these
      actions are deemed proportional to the severity of the associated amount and
      rate of the root cause since the Improper Payments error rate for the Head Start
      program is 1.83% and the Unknown Payments error rate is 3.28%, resulting in
      an overall error rate of 5.10%, which is below the statutory threshold of 10%.
  2024:
    act17_1: HHS's planned and completed actions are focused on the causes of the
      Improper Payments and Unknown Payments in the Head Start program because they
      are based on the specific errors identified during the improper payment review.  Targeted
      technical assistance will be provided to Head Start funding recipients to address
      the underlying causes of the errors.  Further, the corrective actions are focused
      not only on specific errors identified at the Head Start funding recipient level,
      but also on policies, procedures, and processes at the Federal level to support
      Head Start funding recipients.
    act17_2: HHS's corrective actions for the Head Start program are adequate because
      they not only focus on the specific errors identified during the improper payment
      review, but will also evaluate policies, processes, and procedures that could
      lead to improper payments. Corrective actions will also address not only areas
      warranting improvement at the Head Start funding recipient level, but also at
      the HHS level.  HHS also plans to monitor the implementation and interim effectiveness
      of the corrective actions to determine if the corrective actions are adequate
      and having the desired effect or if additional corrective actions are warranted.
    act17_3: HHS will effectively implement and prioritize planned actions to focus
      on the cause of the Improper Payments and Unknown Payments in the Head Start
      program.  HHS will provide targeted technical assistance to Head Start funding
      recipients to address the causes of the identified errors. HHS will also issue
      Information Memorandum and Program Instructions as needed to ensure fiscal and
      program integrity. In addition, HHS will follow-up with individual Head Start
      funding recipients to ensure that corrective action was taken to address the
      identified error causes. HHS is also designating an official who will be accountable
      for the progress of HHS reducing Improper Payments and Unknown Payments in the
      Head Start program. While HHS cannot immediately determine if the planned corrective
      actions are reducing Improper Payments and Unknown Payments, HHS plans to monitor
      the implementation and interim effectiveness of the corrective actions and enhance
      the corrective actions as deemed necessary.
    rnp3: HHS's planned and completed actions address the causes of the Improper Payments
      and Unknown Payments in the Head Start program because they not only focus on
      the specific errors identified during the improper payment review, but will
      also evaluate policies, processes, and procedures that could lead to improper
      payments. Targeted technical assistance will be provided to Head Start funding
      recipients to address the underlying causes of the errors. Planned corrective
      actions will also address not only areas warranting improvement at the Head
      Start funding recipient level, but also at the HHS level.  HHS also plans to
      monitor the implementation and interim effectiveness of the corrective actions
      to determine if additional corrective actions are warranted.  HHS's planned
      actions are proportional to the severity of the associated amount and rate of
      the root causes of errors in the Head Start program as they are based on the
      root causes of errors at both the recipient and federal level.

    rap5: HHS has not determined a tolerable rate for the Head Start program as this
      is the first year for calculating and reporting an Improper and Unknown Payment
      estimate for the program under the new methodology.   HHS anticipates determining
      a tolerable rate in the future once more performance data is available.  Once
      HHS establishes a baseline and develops a tolerable rate for the Head Start
      program, we can assess needs with respect to internal controls, human capital
      and information systems and other infrastructure to reduce improper payments
      and unknown payments to a determined tolerable rate.
    rap6: HHS did not request resources in the most recent budget submission of the
      agency specific to establishing and maintaining controls in the Head Start program
      to reduce the Improper Payments and Unknown Payments to the tolerable rate.  HHS
      has not determined a tolerable rate for the Head Start program as this is the
      first year for calculating and reporting an Improper and Unknown Payment estimate
      for the program under the new methodology.   HHS anticipates determining a tolerable
      rate in the future once more performance data is available.  Once HHS develops
      a tolerable rate for the Head Start program, we will assess resource needs to
      reduce improper payments and unknown payments to a determined tolerable rate,
      and include in the HHS budget submission if warranted.
    rtp4_2: HHS has not determined a tolerable rate for the Head Start program as
      this is the first year for calculating and reporting an Improper and Unknown
      Payment estimate for the program under the new methodology.   HHS anticipates
      determining a tolerable rate in the future once more performance data is available.

    Unknown_Curent_Year_Plus_1_Amount: 0
    cyp15: 'Yes'
    cyp20_2: The reduction target is equal to the estimated future Improper Payment
      and Unknown Payment rate for the Head Start program because the reported Improper
      Payment and Unknown Payment rate exceeded the statutory threshold.  Therefore,
      HHS is taking aggressive action and set a goal to reduce the Head Start Improper
      Payment and Unknown Payment rate below the statutory threshold.
    rap5: HHS has not determined if they have in place what is needed with respect
      to internal controls, human capital, information systems, and other infrastructure
      to reduce Improper Payments and Unknown Payments to the tolerable rate for the
      Head Start program.   HHS has not determined a tolerable rate for the Head Start
      program as this is the second year for calculating and reporting an Improper
      and Unknown Payment estimate for the Head Start program under a new methodology.  HHS
      anticipates determining a tolerable rate in the future once more performance
      data is available.
    rap6: The HHS FY 2025 Justification of Estimates for Appropriations Committees
      request an increase for the Head Start program to support funding to stabilize
      their workforce through increased wages and benefits.  Qualified staff are leaving
      Head Start for better paying jobs, including in public school settings and in
      different sectors such as retail and hospitality. The staffing crisis is due
      to a confluence of factors, including persistently low and stagnant wages, particularly
      for frontline staff, lack of comprehensive benefits, and insufficient supports
      for staff health and wellness. This Budget request provides $543.7 million to
      account for a full Cost of Living Adjustment to support Head Start programs
      to keep pace with inflation. The lack of qualified staff is a contributing factor
      to limited understanding of financial and programmatic policies, processes,
      and procedures, which leads to an increase in the likelihood of improper and
      unknown payments.
    rtp4_2: HHS has not determined a tolerable rate for the Head Start program as
      this is the second year for calculating and reporting an Improper and Unknown
      Payment estimate for the Head Start program under a new methodology.  The wide
      variance between the FY 2023 Improper Payments and Unknown Payments rate of
      5.10% compared to the FY 2024 Improper Payments and Unknown Payments rate of
      11.98% is indicative that HHS does not have sufficient data to determine a tolerable
      rate for the Head Start program.  HHS anticipates determining a tolerable rate
      in the future once more performance data is available.

    cyp6_1: The causes of the technically improper payments in the Head Start program
      were primarily accounting related errors and missing required documentation
      in the records of the sampled Head Start funding recipients.  In several instances,
      payments were made from the incorrect account at the time of payment for which
      the allocation was corrected in a subsequent period.  Additionally, while the
      validity of some payments could be determined, all of the required supporting
      documentation was not maintained in the financial records.

    cyp7_ucp4_1: HHS is unable to determine the specific documentation that the Head
      Start recipient failed to provide.  In one instance, the limitation was imposed
      because the Head Start recipient is the subject of an active fraud investigation,
      which prevented HHS from obtaining any information from the recipient.  In the
      other instance, the Head Start recipient did not provide transaction level detail
      to support expenditures therefore, HHS could not determine the nature of the
      individual expenditures or the documentation required.  In both scenarios, HHS
      is unable to determine if the payment is proper or improper without the documentation
      to conclude if the expenditures qualified as allowable use of funds under the
      Head Start program.
    cyp8: Payments are unknown for the Head Start program because at the time of the
      HHS review, the available documentation was not sufficient to determine if the
      payments were proper or improper.  There were two Head Start recipients that
      fell into this category.  In one instance, the Head Start recipient was the
      subject of an active fraud investigation and thus could not be tested.  In the
      other instance, the Head Start recipient failed to provide sufficient documentation
      at the level of detail necessary to conduct the review.

    cyp8: Payments are unknown for the Head Start program because at the time of the
      HHS review, the available documentation was not available or sufficient to determine
      if the payments were proper or improper. For two large Head Start funding recipients
      selected for testing, the Head Start funding recipients were unable to provide
      sufficient documentation at the level of detail necessary to conduct the review.
      In other instances, the documentation provided was insufficient to support the
      calculations related to the payments.
