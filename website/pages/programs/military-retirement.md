    Description_Action_Taken: "The largest contributor to the improper payments amount\
      \ is under error code R2.5, Errors & Discrepancies in computation of High Average\
      \ (HAVG). When analyzing this error code, it is categorized as both Monetary\
      \ Loss (MLA), within agency control and Underpayments (UN). 49 errors were found\
      \ in testing, resulting in $599.14 in actual monetary loss overpayments and\
      \ $5,881.72 in underpayments. Additionally, several errors were identified in\
      \ which a computation error occurred. These errors cover a variety of computations\
      \ over Military Retirement vast payment distributions and is not tied to a specific\
      \ payment type.  \n\nMilitary Retirement Operations submitted a System Change\
      \ Request (SCR); High 36 Extract Data for Retired Casualty Pay System (RCPS).\
      \ The system change is on track for implementation for calendar year 2024. At\
      \ that time, it is expected that it will resolve discrepant data errors before\
      \ they are transferred to RCPS. On a quarterly basis, will monitor progress\
      \ and ensure SCR remains on schedule.\n\n"

    Description_Action_Taken: "The Department's Military Retirement program will perform\
      \ the following corrective actions. \n1. Continue interagency collaborative\
      \ efforts to correct discrepant data received from the Branch of Service prior\
      \ to establishing the Retired Pay account. These corrections will ensure Military\
      \ Retirement is receiving accurate data to establish the pay account, since\

  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: One of Military Retirement Operations root cause/high
      risk errors was on the accuracy of the Survivor Benefit Plan - Dependency and
      Indemnity Compensation cost refunds being processed. These errors resulted in
      a high amount of improper payments. By Military Retirement and the Department
      prioritizing these corrective actions, the amount of improper payments associated
      with this root cause was successfully reduced.

  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: The FY 2023 Corrective Action Plan (CAP) for the Military
      Retirement Program was developed to reduce the number of improper and unknown
      payments across the program.  The Military Retirement Program worked through
      the CAP and associated milestones, including several process changes and enhancements
      that were implemented. Military Retirement communicated these changes through
      several mechanisms including on the job training to ensure their staff was well
      informed in order to prevent improper payments.

  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: DFAS Military Retirement Operations completed the final
      phase of Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) - Dependency and Indemnity Compensation
      (DIC) offset elimination in January 2023. These mitigation efforts were in response
      to prior Improper Payment findings. The bulk of improper payments are driven
      by cost refund errors when reducing SBP survivor benefits by the amount of DIC
      payments to the member.

  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: Military Retirement Operations collaborated with the
      Disbursing office on a Lean 6 project, focused on refining and enhancing the
      Reclamation Process. This was in preparation of an Internal Review audit slated
      for June 2023 which further tested Disbursing’s reclamation process. Military
      Retirement pursued efforts with Treasury and Veteran Affairs to implement the
      use of the Treasury's Do Not Pay (DNP) database. During Military Retirement’s
      testing it was determined that pertinent death data was missing. As a result,
      Military Retirement pursued receiving data through Experian, it has been determined
      that this source also does not contain all pertinent data and Military Retirement
      and DMDC (Defense Manpower Data Center) are working to reengage with SSA (Social
      Security Administration) to be effective in calendar year 2024. Additionally,
      Military Retirement is pursuing Treasury's DNP for future use as DNP is working
      to obtain the missing data directly from the SSA Death Master file. Military
      Retirement has partnered with other agencies as a part of the Payment Integrity
      Center of Excellence working group, which focuses on synchronization of interagency
      efforts to streamline multiple lines of corrective action efforts and effectiveness
      in reducing IP and UP. The Working Group was established during Q1 FY 2023.

    rnp3: The Department's Military Retirement program program has significantly decreased
      Improper (IP) and Unknown payments (UP). The combined projected IP and UP amounts
      in Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 was $418.83 Million and decreased to $146.36 Million
      in FY 2023. Specifically, the greatest reduction was realized in Monetary loss
      (both inside and outside the Agency control designation). In FY 2022, there
      was a combined $318.10 Million in monetary losses, which was reduced to $75.49
      Million in FY 2023. The reduction of IP and UP is a clear indication of more
      than adequate corrective actions taken coupled with successfully removing the
      Military Retirement program from the OMB High Priority list going into FY 2024.
      Furthermore, the Department, through deliberate synchronized efforts with the
      subject matter experts within the DFAS Military Retirement Operations, have
      strategically crafted additional corrective actions that are highly anticipated
      to continue to reduce IP and UP to the tolerable levels underneath the OMB statutory
      threshold in FY 2024. Once the corrective actions are fully implemented mainly
      the increase in data integrity both in scope and timeliness, continued evolvement
      and enhancement of systems coupled with the strategic mission area realignment,
      the Department is confident that the Military Retirement portfolio will achieve
      PIIA Compliance during the FY 2024 audit.

    rtp4_2: The Department cannot establish an effective tolerable rate until the
      Department can produce reliable Payment Integrity estimates for the programs
      that are currently in Phase II. The DoD Office of the Inspector General (OIG)
      concluded that the previous Department estimates were unreliable and caused
      primarily by using an inappropriate variable which led to insufficient sample
      sizes, and incomplete universe of transactions (UoT) to pull the Payment Integrity
      sample population for testing. The Department has since implemented several
      DoD OIG recommendations by performing UoT reconciliations for the Payment Integrity
      Programs to solidify the Sampling and Estimation Plans and creating a Payment
      Integrity Risk Appetite Statement to verify the effectiveness of the population
      to create the samples from. Additionally, the Department Payment Integrity teams
      have collaborated and have a specific formula that has been approved by the
      DoD OIG to produce more reliable estimates and sufficient sample sizes by testing
      higher and lower risk payment types accordingly. This new formula and process
      will produce estimates that are more reliable and streamline the Department’s
      efforts to achieve Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) Compliance during
      the FY 2023 Payment Integrity compliance audit. Once the Department has DoD
      OIG confirmed reliable estimates, the Department will be able to establish effective
      and cost beneficial tolerable rates for the Payment Integrity programs.

    cyp6_1: The technically improper payments are the result of lack of supporting
      documentation. The identified samples were deemed technically improper due to
      lack of critical details and official correspondence submitted appropriately
      surrounding the member’s death. Documentation to verify the death of the member
      and the manner of the member's death are necessary to determine the validity
      of the payment.

    cyp6_1: The Defense Finance and Accounting Service Military Retirement Operations
      team had relatively minor technically improper payment problems. One example
      was when an Operations team technician made an error in establishing a new account.
      The document in question was not processed until roughly seven weeks after receipt.
      The processing technician needed to review all of the available resources when
      establishing the account to prevent this error.

    cyp7_ucp4_1: The Military Retirement program received two errors in FY 2023 related
      to unknown payments. Both errors were related to insufficient/missing documentation.
      For the missing Survivor Benefit Package (SBP), Military Retirement has controls
      and procedures in place that prevent erroneous SBP elections and enrolls the
      member in auto SBP coverage when SBP election documentation is not received.
      In response to both errors, after reviewing the accounts in its entirety, the
      Military Retirement did have the documentation on file to support the actions
      taken when the accounts were established. Both documents appear to have been
      lost during a system migration and prior to Military Retirement being reabsorbed
      into DFAS. In order to conclude whether or not these payments are proper or
      improper, the Military Retirement will need to receive documentation from both
      the payee and the Branch of Service.
    cyp8: Out of 2,114 samples reviewed, the Military Retirement program had two Unknown
      payment samples in FY 2023, which were related to insufficient documentation.
      In both cases, the errors were attributable to not having complete retirement
      packages available. However, the errors are different in that the first sample
      required documentation from the payee, while the other account required documentation
      from the Branch of Service. In both cases, the Military Retirement Operations
      has requested the documentation from the appropriate parties and will continue
      to track until documentation is received.
