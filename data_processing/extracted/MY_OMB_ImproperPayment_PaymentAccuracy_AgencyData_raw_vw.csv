In FY 2021, VA reports its largest reduction to date of $6.3 billion in improper and unknown payments, a reduction of over 50% from FY2020 results. VA also removed five programs (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA), Compensation, Dependency and Indemnity Compensation, Prosthetics, and State Home Per Diem) from improper payment reporting, as statistically valid testing showed these programs did not have significant improper payments. The removal of these five programs resulted in a total savings of over 25,000 staff hours that could pivot to other work and $340K in contractor costs that would save taxpayer dollars.

VA does not attribute this success to the Treasury Working System, but to the prioritization placed upon and implemented by its employees across the Department to improve internal controls that have resulted in reduction and prevention of improper payments. Agency specific efforts over the last three years include the development of business rules to check for duplicate payments in data repositories and increased use of electronic invoicing and optical character recognition technology.  Additional efforts include artificial intelligence built into the claims processing system that allows claims that meet all rules to auto-adjudicate without human intervention.

The DNP Business Center provides Federal agencies with a web-based single-entry access DNP Portal to these databases & payment data analytics services. DOL agencies implement the DNP Initiative as appropriate for their payment integrity needs.
DNP Working Solution Payment Reviews: The DNP Portal compares the Department’s PAM file of all Treasury disbursed payments against the DMF database. When a payment matches, the payment information is returned to OCFO or responsible agency payment office for adjudication. Matches are reviewed against business rules to cull false-positives. Matches which cannot be culled per business rules are reviewed by agency subject matter experts to determine if the match represents a true positive IP.
DOL Program Reviews of DNP List & non-DNP List Databases: DOL maintains comprehensive, cost effective internal controls to ensure the payment integrity of all programs. Among these controls, programs review private & government-owned databases directly, as appropriate for their business needs. Procurement & grants programs include internal controls requiring review of all vendors against the SAM database. OWCP benefit programs conduct batch matching against the DMF prior to Treasury disbursal. These reviews are designed to prevent IP & vary significantly by specific programmatic need

the Department in 2013 implemented the Department’s OMB-approved plan to perform periodic (primarily weekly) prepayment
eligibility reviews of Do Not Pay portal databases for the Department’s domestic, non-classified, non-employee- related,
non-intragovernmental disbursements. The Department currently performs prepayment checking of the following Do Not
Pay portal databases: (a) Death Master File (DMF) data from the Social Security Administration and from other sources; and
(b) the U.S. General Services Administration’s System for Award Management (SAM) Exclusion Records.

The prepayment checking performed by the Department excludes prepayment eligibility reviews of grantees under ASAP,
as Treasury performs continuous monitoring of the Do Not Pay portal of ASAP grantees. Bureau payment and acquisition
offices, as appropriate, follow up on any vendors initially matched to the Do Not Pay portal databases checked, and perform
further research as necessary to follow through and resolve any issues identified by the Do Not Pay portal matches. In most
cases, the initial matches are subsequently determined by the Department to be false matches. Other Departmental offices
are also consulted as appropriate.

Furthermore, the Department’s payment offices receive, from the Do Not Pay portal, monthly reports listing any match
results of payments made to the following databases: (a) DMF; and (b) SAM Exclusion Records. Payment offices research
and follow up on matches, as appropriate, and submit to the Do Not Pay portal monthly Adjudication Reports summarizing
the results of their efforts.

Since the inception of the payment offices’ Do Not Pay portal prepayment eligibility reviews and reviews of the Do Not Pay
portal post-payment match reports, the Department has not had any significant true matches to DMF and SAM Exclusion

Under updated improper payment guidance in PIIA, DNP continues helps to protect the integrity of the federal government’s payment processes by assisting agencies in mitigating and eliminating improper payments in a cost-effective manner while safeguarding the privacy of individuals.  DNP enables agencies to use a secure online interface to check various data sources to verify eligibility of a vendor, grantee, loan recipient, or beneficiary to receive federal payments.  DNP enables agencies to screen payment recipients on a pre-payment basis against databases, and also provides post-payment screening against these databases to help ensure that any payments to potentially ineligible parties are identified for adjudication and possible recovery.

"DOD","dpa5","[dpa5]Provide a minimum of 2-4 sentences discussing the agency use of Do Not Pay Initiative and an evaluation of whether it has reduced Improper Payments or awards. (Unit- Free-Text)","Defense Finance and Accounting Services (DFAS) Commercial Pay Operations sends a weekly file under the “Batch” process which contains invoices in a pre-payment status.  Results are available and researched the next day in the Do Not Pay (DNP) Portal.  
During FY21, 9.6M invoices amounting to 1.8B were submitted to DNP.  Since the submission is on a weekly basis in the pre-payment environment, some invoices are sent multiple times with no guarantee of actual payment.   Of the matched transactions, 8% are considered true positives, which means the DNP system correctly identified an issue with the vendor.  However, the vendor falls under the established Business Rule which states, if the vendor performed in accordance with their contract they are owed the funds.  Additional reasons that may apply include a vendor may not be required to be registered in SAM based on existing FAR Clauses in their contract.  Of the matched transactions, 92% are false positives with 98% of the false positives related to Death Master Data where a deceased person’s SSN matches a Company’s TIN in error.  
In addition to the Batch process, Commercial Pay Treasury Disbursed (TDD) payments are ran through the DNP Death Master databases.  This process has not reduced or prevented any improper payments.  Transactions are researched to determine whether they are a false positive or if collection action must be initiated with adjudication in the portal after research.  

For Military Health Benefits the Defense Health Agency Contract Resource Management (DHA-CRM) individual Payments: DHA-CRM processes relatively few (5–55) case recoupment small ($5–$40,000) refunds each month.  The Single Online Search (SOS) service is utilized, prepayment, for 100% of all case recoupment refunds to verify a payee not been placed on the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE) and to verify an individual has not passed away. Any matches will be referred to the DHA Office of General Counsel for adjudication.  
Vendor, Contract Payments: CRM processes approximately 191 routine payments per month for 13 unique TRICARE private sector care (PSC) payees. The SOS service is utilized, prepayment, once a month to verify a PSC payee has not been placed on the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) or the LEIE. The initial DNP Portal (DNP) check is then carried for all remaining payments being made to that unique payee for the rest of the month.  This process is then repeated every month, maintaining 100% validation in the DNP. Any matches are validated with the Treasury Offset Program (TOP), ensuring the contractor does not have the same EIN as a person’s SSN.  If the contractor is on the SAM, LEIE, and/or TOP list, the finding is referred to the assigned Contracting Officer.  For proprietary reasons, the contractor is responsible for resolving these matching issues. 
The risk for payments disbursed via the PSC contractor lies outside of CRM’s control. Contractors are not required to utilize the DNP at the pre-payment phase to comply with PIIA.

(Unit- Free-Text)","The Department of Justice has access to all DNP data sources that are helpful in identifying potential improper payments and awards.  The Department’s use of the sources in FY 2021 identified three improper payments totaling $10,241.  The Department attributes the very low rate to the strength of the prepayment controls in place within the Department’s components and built into the financial systems.  

No data sources were added to the DNP library in FYs 2021 or 2020.  Two data sources added to the library in FY 2019 – American Info Source (AIS)-Obituary and AIS-Probate – continue to account for false hits for the Department.  Each of these are commercial data sources looking at obituaries and probate records to identify deceased individuals. 

During FY 2021, the AIS-Obituary and AIS-Probate data sources identified 96 hits for the Department.  For all but 1 hit, the Department confirmed the payments were proper.  Many of the hits were attributed to current, living employees receiving proper payments (e.g., a travel reimbursement) and deemed false hits.","2021"

SAM:  We currently comply with regulations to use List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), which accomplishes the same purpose as the Exclusions query via SAM.gov.  From SAM.gov, we can verify through Entity Registrations if any person or organization is registered to do business with the Federal Government and determine a person or organization’s eligibility to do business with the Federal Government through a check of the Exclusions query.

As prescribed in our policy, the State disability determination services (DDS) offices are required to check the LEIE at least annually.  LEIE includes the names of providers excluded from Federally funded health care programs.  The DDS offices also verify medical licenses, credentials, and certifications with State medical boards.  In addition, because the DDS offices are State agencies, they do not have direct access to DNP.

DMF:  The DMF is a publicly available extract of death information created from our own internal records (i.e., the Numident).  These records contain basic information, such as name, Social Security number (SSN), date of birth, and date of death of deceased SSN holders.  We update death information on the Numident daily based on information from acceptable reporters (e.g., States, funeral homes, and family members).  We distribute reported death information to our related records using a complex systems interface.  Because our internal death data is more complete than the extracts, we do not use DNP for purposes of verifying death.

Prisoner Information:  To comply with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, we collaborated with Treasury’s Bureau of Fiscal Service to provide current prisoner information.  Because our PUPS is more complete than the data available via DNP, we use our own internal data to verify incarceration.

(Unit- Free-Text)","During FY 2022, the average number of DNP searches increased by 8% from FY 2021 (109,746 to 118,064). One contributing factor to this change can be attributed to the increase in funding programs received from pandemic-related assistance programs. The various pandemic-related assistance programs broadened USDA programs in a variety of ways including the amount of funding they could provide, a change in eligibility requirements, and other programmatic changes. 
USDA has increased its active users from 1,600 in FY 2021 to 1,780 in FY 2022. These users span five agencies and multiple program areas. The USDA DNP Authorizing Official (AO), in tandem with the Primary Local Security Administrator (PLSA), provided administrative support to programs currently using DNP during the pre-award, pre-payment, and post-payment phases of the payment life cycle. USDA has also begun the enrollment and onboarding process with two additional agencies, which will result in the potential of adding approximately 1,500 more DNP users. The enrollment process is expected to be completed during FY 2023.

DNP specifically helps the Department prevent improper payments by matching all of our payments against the death data sources on a daily basis.  For FY 2023, DNP identified 5 DOT payments that matched against the death data sources amounting to approximately $6,000.  Even though all FY 2023 matches were proper payments, the information enabled DOT staff to take proactive measures and reduce repeat occurrences.

Overall, the Department has neither identified a material amount nor realized a material reduction of improper payments attributable to the implementing the DNP capabilities.

Cost analysis reviews conducted to date have not successfully determined that any of the programs would be cost beneficial for recovery audit efforts. DHS continues to refine the information within the analysis, and if determined to be cost effective, will work through procurement channels to move forward with establishing a recovery audit mechanism going forward. Analysis has covered all DHS Components, applicable payment types, and programs.

(Unit - Free-Text)","Benefit Payments disburses over $5 billion in payments annually to over 800,000 participants each month. Due to the dollar value, payment volume, program complexity, and nature of pension payments, PBGC has implemented electronic data analysis, including death match and other procedures, to identify payments that may be in error. Potential improper payments are subjected to further analysis based on the amount of the payment, the nature of the potential error, and other risk factors to determine whether amounts are due to PBGC. PBGC has established procedures to recapture overpayments through recovery payments, installment repayment agreements, offsets against other continuing benefits to recoup amounts owed by the participant, or referrals to the Department of Treasury’s Centralized Receivables Service. In some cases, recapture of payments may not be sought based on demonstration that a participant is experiencing financial hardship or other reasons.

Contractor Payments includes the disbursement of over $300 million annually. Due to the dollar value, payment volume, and the nature of contract payments, PBGC has implemented electronic data analysis, including do not pay matching and other procedures, to identify payments that may be in error. In addition,
invoice reviews are periodically performed to help assess the accuracy of amounts billed. Potential improper payments are subjected to further analysis based on the amount of the payment, the nature of the potential error, and other risk factors to determine whether amounts are due to PBGC. PBGC has
established procedures under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to seek reimbursement from contractors that have been overpaid. Further, under the FAR, previous payments are made are generally subject to adjustment based on over or under payments and any amounts due are normally addressed prior to or at contract closeout.

Payments to Federal Employees includes disbursement of about $150 million annually. PBGC’s payroll and other employee payments are processed by the Department of the Interior’s (DOI) Interior Business Center (IBC). PBGC receives a Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 18 report that reports on the DOI IBC payment operations. No weaknesses related to payroll and other employee payments were reported in the most recent SSAE No. 18. Included in PBGC’s and DOI’s internal controls are that a series of personnel actions are needed to change salaries or process bonus payments. Also, employees receive a payroll statement every two weeks. While mistakes can occur in any operation, PBGC has not experienced significant levels of improper payroll payments. Also, if a mistake is identified, any overpayments can be netted against or offset future payments to those employees or deducted from the last paycheck processed after termination. A review of the following did not identify
significant payment issues:
>Improper payment risk assessments,
>agency Inspector General reviews,
>Government Accountability Office reports, and
>results of the agency audit resolution and follow up process.

Given the historic low risk nature of payroll disbursements, including the existence of adequate payment processing controls and reviews, and the ability to readily recover any improper payments by offset against future payments through normal payroll operations, establishing a separate payment recapture
program for this payment stream is unnecessary and would not be cost effective.

Multiemployer Plan Financial Assistance includes disbursement of over $160 million per year. MEPD generally processes an average of 357 financial assistance payments annually to an average of 95 plans. Multiemployer plans are required to provide proof of plan insolvency, sign promissory agreements, and
undergo an initial audit to determine if the plan is eligible to receive ongoing assistance from the PBGC. Additionally, multiemployer plans are required to provide documentation to support estimates of future expenses prior to receiving financial assistance on a yearly, semi annually, quarterly, or monthly basis. The PBGC’s Multiemployer Program Division (MEPD) reviews all financial assistance requests in accordance with established policies and procedures to verify requests are reasonable, complete, accurate, and comply with ERISA. MEPD rejects or reduces the amount of financial assistance requested by plans if
the administrative and/or benefit expenses do not agree to supporting documentation or if there was a prior overpayment. Additionally, throughout the year, plans submit documentation to support actual expenses incurred to validate a plan’s previous estimate of plan expenses and adjust the most recent financial
assistance request amount if the actual amount of expenses significantly varied from the plan’s initial estimate, and MEPD auditors review this documentation and perform a detailed reconciliation. Multiemployer plans are insolvent and generally have no other sources of financial resources beyond PBGC. In addition, there are just over 100 plans, so this is not a large universe of payees to monitor within the existing structure. A review of the following did not identify significant payment issues:
>improper payment risk assessment
>agency Inspector General reviews,
>Government Accountability Office reports, and
>results of the agency audit resolution and follow up process.

Given the lower payment dollar value and volume, the nature of the multiemployer plan financial assistance program, payment processing controls, and the ability to adjust future financial assistance amounts by actual expenses incurred, establishing a separate payment recapture program for this payment stream would not be considered cost effective.

Premium Refunds issued ranges roughly $88 to $203 million on an annual basis. All premium refund requests are subject to review  prior to disbursement with larger payments subjected to additional approvals. Given that each pension plan has an ongoing account with PBGC as to premium amounts due, any adjustments for under or over payments can be reflected in the PBGC’s Statement of Account for each plan. Plans may contest any attempt to recapture overpayments. A review of the following did not identify significant payment issues:
> Improper payment risk assessments,
> agency Inspector General reviews,
> Government Accountability Office reports, and
> results of the agency audit resolution and follow up process.

Based on above and especially since there is not significant dollar value or payment volume associated with this payment stream, establishing a separate payment recapture program for this payment stream is not considered cost effective.","2023"

(Unit - Free-Text)","Condition 1: The payment of real estate taxes in most leases is designed to be a passthrough from the landlord’s real estate tax bill.  The landlord pays the taxing authority and GSA pays the landlord for its share based on percentage occupancy of the building.  The real estate payment is incorporated into the GSA annual rent payment.  If the actual taxes are more than the amount paid through rent, GSA owes the landlord the difference.  If the actual taxes are less than the amount paid through rent, the landlord owes GSA the difference.  Recoveries arise when Lessor fails to report either of these two scenarios by not sending GSA the appropriate tax bills.    
Resolution 1: GSA has established agencywide procedures to perform annual reviews of all leases when the landlord does not send in taxes.  These procedures have significantly decreased improper payments in this area in the last 4 years.

Condition 2: There are several variables that can cause overpayments at the start up of a lease such as broker commission credits, free rent credits, and credits for holdover payments on a preceding lease, etc.  The overpayments exist if these credits are not entered in the billing system (REXUS) or not properly transferred from the billing system to the payment system (Pegasys).
Resolution 2: Checklists have been developed in GSA's Regions to ensure that all credits are entered into the billing system (REXUS).  Also, in July of 2020, the REXUS to Pegasys interface automatically transfers data from REXUS to Pegasys so that it is no longer a manual process of entering credit data for leases into Pegasys which has helped reduce errors.","2023"

The three identified reports include vendors with matched results of “Possible”, “Probable”, and “Conclusive”.  The information reported to the CSOSA Office of Procurement (Procurement) is based on those vendors with a “Conclusive” match result.  OFM issues an email to Procurement on a weekly basis identifying those vendors who appeared on the DNP Report.

Where the system identifies exclusion matches for supplier records of POs with funding exhausted, DOE would close such records. A note is then added in the DBA name field that the vendor has an active exclusion. A request to reopen the supplier would alert the supplier team to perform mandatory validation checks before reopening. This ensures no new awards are granted to suppliers with active exclusions. DOE also send a daily file to DNP for Batch Matching to ensure that there are no missed data source matches in the Continuous Monitoring process that would result from any timing issues.
DOE utilizes DNP as a proactive solution for reducing/preventing improper payments as opposed to being reactive. During FY 2022, there were 5 supplier records closed due to active SAM Exclusion matches in DNP. Closing of supplier records prevents procurement offices from entering into any new contracts with the vendors which could result in improper payments. Since DNP is a proactive solution to preventing improper payments, quantitative amount of the dollar or number of improper payments prevented by the use of DNP cannot be made; otherwise, the cost of tracking would outweigh the benefit.

PIIA requires agencies to review and assess all programs and activities with annual outlays greater than $10,000,000 for improper payment risk at least once every three years to identify those susceptible to significant improper payments.
DOE conducts risk assessments on a three-year cycle for all programs with outlays over $10M.

Risk assessments were conducted for five of the six payment types resulting in a Low-risk rating for them under the DOE Payment Integrity Program.
DOE also conducts site-specific reviews and analysis of accounting and financial records, supporting documentation, and other pertinent information supporting payments.  These activities are detective and corrective in nature, and are designed to identify and recapture overpayments.

13 programs were categorized as Phase 2; and
38 programs had outlays less than $10M.

During FY 2023, USDA had one program that was considered a High-Priority program: RMA FCIC. This was a reduction from FY 2022, when USDA had three High-Priority programs. Additionally, three programs categorized as Phase 2 during FY2022 were moved to Phase 1 during FY2023. 

These programs are: 
Commodity Credit Corp Trade Mitigation Program
Farm Service Agency Quality Loss Adjustment Program (QLA)
Forest Service Disaster Supplemental- Capital Improvement and Maintenance


USDA continues to work towards reducing the Departments improper payment rates though utilization of improved training programs, implementation of more stringent internal controls, and the growth of USDA’s use of the Do Not Pay initiative.

(Unit - Free-Text)","Federal Student Aid's (FSA’s) Federal Pell Grant (Pell) and William D. Ford Direct Loan (Direct Loan) programs are considered Phase 2 programs per OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C (“A-123C”). The major causes of improper payments (IP) and unknown payments (UP) in FY 2023 are related to misreported income, credit balance deficiencies, incorrect financial aid determination, and student withdrawal deficiencies. These root causes are consistent with those identified for prior year IP and UP estimates. FSA has developed corrective action plans to mitigate and prevent IPs and UPs that are within FSA’s control. For example, FSA is in the process of implementing the authorities provided in the FUTURE Act to directly authenticate applicants’ and borrowers’ income data. IPs and UPs that are outside of FSA’s control are mainly attributed to challenges at institutions that are responsible for disbursing Pell and Direct Loan funds. FSA will continue to provide training to institutions through various avenues, such as the FSA Annual Conference, and perform various oversight activities to ensure institutions meet FSA requirements for institutional eligibility, financial responsibility, and administrative capability.  

The FY 2023 IP and UP rate for the Pell program is 2.83% up from 2.24% in FY 2022. The increase in the FY 2023 Pell estimate over FY 2022 is primarily due to an increase in misreported income root cause over and underpayments as derived from an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) Statistical Study that compares recipients’ self-reported income data to their Federal tax information (FTI) maintained by the IRS.  The FY2023 IP and UP rate for the Direct Loan program is 0.70%, down from 0.75% in FY 2022.  The decrease in the FY 2023 Direct Loan estimate from FY 2022 is primarily due to a decrease in overpayments as derived from compliance audit data.  

The Department also estimated the FY 2023 IP and UP rates for three non-FSA Phase 2 programs: Title I, Part A (Title I), Education Stabilization Fund (ESF), and the Special Education Grants to States program under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The FY 2023 IP and UP rates for the Title I, ESF, and IDEA programs are 0.00004%, 0.0002%, and 0.0001%, down from FY 2022 rates of 35.72%, 12.09%, and 26.71%, respectively.  

In FY 2022, the primary driver of the high reported estimated IP and UP rates reported was Unknown Payments resulting from a lack of documentation (due to the delayed start of the payment integrity studies) and the payment recipients not understanding what type of supporting documentation to provide to satisfy the requirements of the studies. In response to the FY 2022 results, the Department implemented effective mitigation strategies in FY 2023 which resulted in the elimination of UPs in these 3 programs. This dramatically reduced the estimated IP and UP rates in FY 2023. The strategies the Department implemented are as follows:

1. The Department began the FY 2023 payment integrity studies earlier in the fiscal year, providing sufficient time for State Education Agencies (SEAs) to obtain and provide supporting documentation from Local Education Agencies (LEAs) for the programs’ payments.

2. The Department provided SEAs with targeted technical assistance and training throughout FY 2023. This assistance encompassed technical assistance meetings with certain states, written guidance, and payment documentation criteria guidance.

As a direct result of these strategies, the Department is currently reporting extremely low FY 2023 rates, mainly attributed to a small number of payment rounding errors. In addition, the Department formally issued its policy on Payment Integrity, providing guidance to agency employees, in FY 2023.

Finally, the Department continues its efforts to collect confirmed IPs. Regarding payment recapture audits, the Department has determined that these types of audits would not be cost effective for any of its programs and activities. However, the Department identifies and recovers IPs through sources other than payment recapture audits and works with grantees and Title IV (FSA) program participants to resolve and recover amounts identified in compliance audits, OIG audits, and program reviews. The Department also analyzes the return of grant funds from recipients to determine if they are due to IPs. When an IP is detected and deemed collectable, the Department establishes an account receivable and pursues collection. Additionally, the Department has wide discretion to decide not to collect IPs from grantees in cases where it determines that pursuing collections would cause more harm to the federal interest.","2023"

(Unit - Free-Text)","Fiscal Service programs- Management has determined that conducting recovery audits would not be cost-effective. Fiscal Service makes payments based on the public law, adjudications, or payment certification from Federal Agencies. Although, a formal recovery audit is not performed, internal reviews are conducted before all payments are made. A justification was submitted to OMB in 2018 to request exemption for reporting recovery audits for this fund group.

Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Programs- Per OMB's letter to Treasury Assistant Secretary for Management, dated March 20, 2014, IRS custodial/bond programs are exempt from Payment Recapture Auditing. Treasury determined that it considers these payments negative revenue receipts- not outlays- and thereby
exempt them from improper payment requirements. OMB believed this is a reasonable approach, however these custodial/bond programs are still required to assess for risk. IRS programs that are not custodial/bond programs submitted a justification to OMB in 2016 to exempt them from recovery auditing. The five year average cost of recovery auditing far exceeded the average improper payments identified. No improper payments were recaptured through recovery auditing, however, all funds recaptured were identified through normal operating processes and collected through established procedures. Pre-payment reviews are conducted for the purposes of preventing, identifying, and recovering improper payments for contracts, modifications, and task orders.

IRS- fund groups relating to the COVID-19 pandemic created through the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, including the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, provided a justification for determination that recovery auditing is not cost effective in FY 2023. Current business practices (e.g., audit reports, self-reported overpayments, statistical samples conducted under PIIA) provide an efficient and effective means for identification of overpayments. The IRS’s robust information
technology platform includes several filters to monitor the accuracy of eligibility
rules and payment certification for the various tax credits.

The Office of International Assistance provided a cost-effective justification to OMB for recovery auditing in 2018. Payments for this fund group can be in two forms: payment vouchers on letter of credit which are administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and direct cash payments via the Secure Payment System. Internal reviews are performed before all payments are made. Management has determined that it would not be cost-effective to perform formal recovery auditing on this fund group.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) submitted a cost-effective justification for recovery auditing to OMB in 2018. The justification was based on the following: The OCCs improper payment risk assessment for the five categories of payments (contract payments - invoices, travel card, purchase card,
payroll, and benefits) has resulted in a low risk rating since at least FY 2012. The OCC has strong internal controls over payments as validated by A-123 testing. The OCC conducts ongoing internal reviews of travel vouchers, purchase cards, and other transactions. The OCC performs an annual review using analytic techniques of contract payments to identify potential fraudulent activity or other payment anomalies. The OCC has very low delinquency and unauthorized use rates for government travel and purchase cards and for expenditures of OCC funds outside of prescribed policies and procedures. The most recent payment recapture audit activities conducted required a higher cost in employee resources than the amount recovered.

The Treasury Franchise Fund submitted a cost-effective justification to OMB in 2018. The qualitative risk assessments for this fund group have been low risk since 2013. Prior fiscal year recovery audits before the justification was established yielded .01% of disbursements for this fund group. This fund group conducts pre-payment and post-payment reviews. Because of these reasons, management determined it would not be cost-effective to conduct recovery audits on this fund group.

The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) submitted a cost-effective justification for recovery auditing to OMB in 2019. The basis of this justification is the BEP's risk assessments are consistently low risk for improper payments. Prior fiscal years found that the improper payment dollar amount for BEP equates to
.004% of the total disbursements for the program. BEP continues to do pre-payment and post-payment reviews.

Departmental Offices- Economic Stabilization Direct Loan Financing program is at low risk for improper payments. This loan program is unique in that it contains a limited number of recipients. In FY 2020, there were eight recipients that received eight large payments and in total, the program disbursed loans to 35 recipients. Program participants entered into stringent legal agreements per guidance stipulated in the CARES Act and instituted per Treasury. There were significant reviews performed at the onset of the program including several levels of review regarding program loan terms and documentation. Further, given these disbursements are loans, which are closely monitored for potential default, Treasury expects to receive the funds back. 

Departmental Office- Payroll Support Program- Since there is a payment recovery process instituted within the program’s internal controls system and the risks of improper payments are low, the potential benefit of conducting a separate
payment recapture audit is minimal and would be duplicative. This payment recovery process is comprised of confirming maximum awardable amounts and verifying that the prorated payments are within the established percentages and maximum payments allowed for each program participant. The cost of
performing a payment recapture audit would outweigh any potential benefit.

Departmental Offices- Coronavirus Economic Relief for Transportation Services (CERTS)- The CERTS program identified one instance of overpayment, and one instance of ineligibility, both were 100% recaptured, and represent less than 0.1% of the total program awards. As of August 2022, the CERTS program has since completed all of its awards to recipients and is shifting to the recipient monitoring
phase of the program. Since there is a low prevalence of overpayments and payments to ineligible recipients, and a 100% recapture rate, the potential benefit of conducting a separate payment recapture audit is minimal. Therefore, the cost of performing a recapture audit would outweigh any potential benefit.

Departmental Office- Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund (SLFRF)- In FY 2021 SLFRF identified three overpayments, which were 100% recaptured, and represent less than 1.0% of the total program awards. In each of these three cases, recipients notified Treasury of the overpayments and were provided instructions on how to return funds to Treasury. SLFRF worked closely with the ORP Payment Operations team to recoup overpayments and ensure the returned amount was documented accurately in the Oracle SAR report, which serves as the ORP payment system of record. Since the program has implemented multiple levels of control activities to enhance the frequency and quality of payment integrity review, the risks of improper payments are low and the potential benefit of conducting a separate payment recapture audit is minimal. Therefore, the cost of performing a payment recapture audit would outweigh any potential benefit.

Departmental Office- Emergency Rental Assistance- Eligibility for payments from Treasury to participating entities are made by Treasury according to statutory allocations. The payments team uses various systems to validate the information, such as Sam.gov, Oracle, and Salesforce. Initial eligibility of recipients is verified using the Do Not Pay Portal. Payments are approved for disbursement after
undergoing a multi-step validation process to verify the recipient, dollar amount, and timing. Once approved, payments are disbursed following the standard ORP payments process. Since the program has implemented multiple levels of review (drawing from multiple data sources) into its internal controls system, the risks of improper payments are low and the potential benefit of conducting a separate payment recapture audit is minimal and would be duplicative.

Departmental Offices- Homeowner Assistance Fund- Eligibility for payments from Treasury to participating entities are made by Treasury according to statutory allocations. The payments team uses various systems to validate the information, such as Sam.gov, Oracle, and Salesforce. Initial eligibility of recipients are verified using the Do Not Pay Portal. Payments are approved for disbursement after
undergoing a multi-step validation process to verify the recipient, dollar amount, and timing. Since the program has implemented multiple levels of review (drawing from multiple data sources) into its internal controls system, the risks of improper payments are low and the potential benefit of conducting a separate payment recapture audit is minimal and would be duplicative.

Departmental Offices- Emergency Capital Investment Program- During the application phase, ECIP consulted with the primary federal regulators for each applicant (being a regulated financial institution) to confirm that it was eligible to receive funding. The underwriting process was conducted in coordination
with teams of community development finance and financial institutions and external financial advisers. ECIP program management was required to approve each investment decision, based on established procedures which incorporated risk management controls and included multiple layers of review. Since the
program has implemented multiple levels of review involving multiple outside and independent assessments, the risks of improper payments are low and the potential benefit of conducting a separate payment recapture audit is minimal and would be duplicative.

Departmental Offices/Office of Recovery Programs- Local Assistance and Tribal Consistency Fund (LATCF)-  LATCF has maintained its own listing and database of eligible primary recipients, and therefore, the eligibility risk of primary recipients is essentially zero. Since LATCF has multiple levels of internal/quality controls to enhance the frequency and quality of the payment integrity review, the risks of improper payments are low.

Departmental Offices/Office of Recovery Programs- State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI)- The SSBCI program team relies on a vigorous SSBCI application review process and conducts post-approval procedures through SSBCI’s Compliance Program. The application process includes checks to validate 
identity, confirm eligibility, and ensure accurate inputs for the payment (grant sizing) formula, as well as verify that the applicant is not on exclusion lists (including the Do Not Pay Portal) dedicated to preventing improper payments.

Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR)- SIGPR has an established inter-agency agreement (IAA) and service level agreement (SLA) in place with the Treasury’s Administrative Resource Center (ARC) Financial Services program for providing financial support services. As it relates
specifically to recovery processes this includes but is not limited to activities such as performing funds control reviews and maintenance on a weekly basis and review recovery analysis. ARC has processes in place for financial reporting and reconciliations on a routine basis to identify, prevent and/or recover improper payments based on established thresholds. SIGPR has also developed and implemented policies and procedures to ensure controls over payments are implemented, including daily financial reporting and reconciliations to identify, prevent and/or recover improper payments based on established thresholds.
Since there are payment recovery processes included within the aforementioned policies and procedures and the risks of improper payments are low, the potential benefit of conducting separate payment recapture audits is minimal and would be duplicative.

Office of DC Pensions (DCP)-  DCP's largest payment area, benefits, has a robust multi-tier quality review program that includes in-depth annuitant case review as a part of their normal course of business. Through DCP's quality review program, significant numbers of annuitant cases are reviewed monthly and when errors are detected, benefit payments are corrected and debt collection activities begin, as applicable. In addition, all contract payments and Federal Employee Payments include a second level review prior to payment submission.","2023"

(Unit - Free-Text)","For both the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income programs, much of the overpayments occur outside of the agency’s control.  However, we continue to find ways to influence change where possible and focus on mitigation strategies within our control.","2023"
"HUD","arp17","[arp17]Provide a minimum of 2-4 sentences discussing the conditions giving rise to Overpayments identified in recovery AUDITS and how those conditions are being resolved. (Unit - Free-Text)","For internal offsets, over-claimed amounts (negative claims) occur when the mortgagee owes FHA. The Single-Family Claims Branch (SFCB) sends billing letters to lenders for the excess amounts claimed and tracks the receivables using the Accounts Receivables Sub-system (ARS). Receivables are established in SFCB’s ARS and identified by an FHA case number. Each FHA case number is further identified by Section of the Act (which is linked to the appropriate fund) and endorsement date. This later date identifies the cohort year. The Holder of record to which the claim funds were originally disbursed is identified in ARS as the debtor, by default. When the receivable is subsequently liquidated by funds remitted by a Mortgagee or by offset, the collected amount is posted to the previously identified FHA case number, Section of the Act, and cohort year.

If a payment is not received from a lender within 90 days, the receivable is offset against subsequent claims by the lender until the full amount of the receivable is satisfied. If a receivable is not satisfied within 120-150 days, it is referred to the FOC in Albany, NY for enforced collection actions. At that time, the FOC officially confirms acceptance of the transfer of an aged delinquent debt, and that receivables have been removed from the ARS with the notation that it has been referred to the FOC for recovery.
Another avenue by which improper payments are recaptured is through Post Claim Reviews for title II Single Family Insurance Claims. A statistical sample of settled claims is reviewed for compliance with FHA servicing and claim filing requirements. A report on findings, is prepared and issued to the individual mortgagee. Mortgagees can refute the findings by providing additional documents before a final report is issued. If the Mortgagee chooses to pay the monetary findings prior to HUD’s issuance of the final report, those funds are deposited to ARS, which applies them to the Mortgage Insurance (MI) fund. Upon issuance of the final report, it is referred to the FOC which establishes it as a receivable and tracks it until paid in full. If a lender is overpaid on a Multifamily claim, the Multifamily Claims Branch will demand the overage back from the lender. If the lender fails to respond to their demands, the debt is referred to the FOC for collection. Lastly, for Treasury Cross-Servicing, the collection of generic debt is governed by the Debt Collection Improvement Act and HUD policies (Title I and Other Debt Collection Guidance 4740.2). The Act requires federal agencies to refer eligible delinquent debts to Treasury (for Cross-Servicing and TOP) when the debt is 120 days delinquent.

The Treasury’s TOP allows federal agencies to report delinquent non-tax debt to the Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS). BFS performs computer matching with disbursement data and processes an offset when an appropriate match is determined. After referral, Treasury and its private collection agencies are responsible for contacting the debtor to collect the payment of the debt. The Treasury’s Cross-Servicing is a process used by BFS to refer the debt collection to a private collection agency, among other actions, to collect delinquent debts on behalf of Federal Agencies.

The FOC’s recapture process establishes receivables in DCAMS and issues a demand notice to the debtor(s). If the debt remains unpaid, DCAMS issues a “Notice of Intent” warning regarding enforced collection measures and informs the debtor regarding their due process rights. DCAMS automatically reports information to credit bureaus and CAIVRS. Penalty and administrative cost charges are also automatically assessed if warranted. 

If the debt remains unpaid, it is referred to Treasury (within 180 days) for offset via the government-wide TOP and for direct collection action by Treasury and Treasury contracted private collection agencies. Treasury also initiates referral to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for civil litigation and/or initiates Administrative Wage Garnishment (AWG) action if they deem such action to be appropriate. If Treasury’s Cross-Servicing action is not successful, Treasury “returns” the debt to the FOC. If older than two years, the receivable is written-off and the case is reclassified “currently not collectible.” The FOC keeps the case open if offset via TOP appears fruitful or if other collection measures are applicable (e.g., AWG action by HUD). Otherwise, the FOC terminates collection action, closes the case, and the system issues an IRS Form 1099C “Cancellation of Debt,” the following January if appropriate. Write-off, Termination, close-out, and 1099C issuance can also occur at any point in the above collection cycle if determined appropriate (e.g., debtor is discharged as bankrupt).

Collections from debtors to HUD go to the Treasury Lockbox Network or Pay.gov. Collections from debtors to Treasury or DOJ come to HUD via interagency transfer (i.e., Intra-Governmental Payment and Collection (IPAC)). No matter the route, all payments are posted to the receivable in DCAMS.","2023"

Each year, HHS performs a number of activities as required by the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA).  For Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 (October 1, 2022 – September 30, 2023), these activities included:

1) Conducting 56 program-specific improper payment risk assessments;
2) Updating the improper payment risk assessment questionnaire, the risk factor calculation, and Risk Assessment Portal; 
3) Developing policies, procedures, and supporting tools to facilitate coverage of all programs over $10 million;
4) Monitoring low-risk programs that were not subject to improper payment risk assessments, as needed;
5) Reporting quarterly information for seven high-priority programs to OMB’s PaymentAccuracy.gov website;
6) Developing and implementing improper payment methodologies for two new programs reporting in FY 2023 for the first time (ACF’s Head Start program and HRSA’s COVID-19 Uninsured Program);
7) Reporting a total of 10 improper payment estimates; and
8) Leveraging improper payment results to identify root causes and establish and refine corrective actions. 

In FY 2023, HHS reported improper and unknown payment estimates for two new programs at risk for significant improper payments. Additionally, six programs reduced their improper and unknown payment rates, while two programs saw an increase. Specifically, changes in statistical sampling methods caused an increase in improper and unknown payment rates for Medicare Part C and Medicare Part D. More information on these improper payment results and activities can be found on PaymentAccuracy.gov and HHS’s annual Agency Financial Report (available at HHS.gov/afr).  

In the latest compliance audit covering FY 2022 results, HHS's Inspector General determined that the agency did not comply with PIIA for the following reasons:

1) Medicaid and CHIP had improper payment and unknown payment rates exceeding 10%.
2) Not all risk-susceptible programs reported improper payment and unknown payment rates.
3) Medicare FFS did not demonstrate improvements in payment integrity.
4) HHS did not conduct a risk assessment for all programs with annual outlays over $10 million at least once every three years.
5) Recovery audits and activities performed to recover improper
payments for Medicare Part C and Medicare Part D programs are delayed or
missing cost-effectiveness documentation.

Below is further information on activities HHS has underway or anticipates implementing in the future to help these programs achieve compliance.  
Medicaid and CHIP:  HHS works closely with states to create corrective action plans for Medicaid and CHIP programs in each state, offering comprehensive technical support and guidance to address identified errors and deficiencies. In FY 2021, HHS set a new baseline for Medicaid and CHIP under revised eligibility criteria. Estimates for both programs decreased in FY 2022 and FY 2023. As of FY 2023, the improper and unknown payment rate for Medicaid is under 10%, and HHS expects the program to achieve compliance with PIIA in the upcoming compliance audit.

Reporting Improper Payment Estimates for All Phase 2 Programs:  In FY 2023, HHS will report improper payment and unknown payment rates for the COVID-19 Uninsured Program and Head Start for the first time. The Foster Care program did not provide an improper payment estimate due to the suspension of onsite reviews during the COVID-19 pandemic in FY 2020. Onsite reviews will resume, and an improper payment rate will be reported in FY 2024.

HHS is actively working to establish a methodology for measuring and reporting improper payments in the TANF program. In the FY 2024 President's Budget request, HHS has proposed new statutory authority to collect more comprehensive data on TANF. This proposal aims to improve monitoring of TANF spending and facilitate the development and reporting of improper payment estimates.

In FY 2022, HHS reported its first improper payment measurement for the Federally-facilitated Exchange for the Advance Premium Tax Credit program. HHS is also developing an improper payment methodology for State-based Exchanges and introduced the Improper Payment Pre-testing and Assessment program in April 2023 to prepare State Marketplaces for the planned improper payment measurement. HHS will continue to update its annual agency financial reports with the progress in measurement development and implementation.

Medicare Fee-For-Service:  In FY 2023, Medicare FFS maintained its improper payment rate below 10% for the seventh consecutive year. HHS strengthened corrective measures for Hospice and SNF services, the primary drivers of Medicare FFS improper payments.

Improper Payment Risk Assessments:  Agencies are required to assess programs with annual outlays exceeding $10 million for improper payment risk at least once every three years to identify susceptibility to significant improper payments. In FY 2023, HHS assessed 56 programs and found them not susceptible to significant improper payments. HHS also updated risk assessments and developed related policies, procedures, and tools. The agency aims to review and assess all programs for significant improper payments by FY 2025.

Part C and Part D Recovery Audits:  For Medicare Part C, the Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) audit program, which is the primary corrective action regarding Part C's improper payments, performs Part C recovery audit functions. The RADV program is consistent with recovery audit requirements and advances corrective actions for the Medicare Part C program.  In January 2023, HHS finalized a rule to begin the recovery of overpayments under the RADV program. HHS plans to initiate recoveries for completed RADV audits, as results are finalized, starting with payment year (PY) 2011. 

The Plan Program Integrity Medicare Drug Integrity Contractor (PPI-MEDIC) performs the Part D recovery audit functions. The PPI-MEDIC has a robust program to identify improper payments. HHS recovered $6.6 million from Part D sponsors in FY 2023 because of the PPI- MEDIC projects and Part D plan sponsor self-audits.","2023"

(Unit- Free-Text)","HHS uses the Do Not Pay Initiative to review payment eligibility for purposes of identifying and preventing improper payments. HHS utilizes the Treasury Working System to screen payments against the Do Not Pay death record databases. On a quarterly basis, HHS reviews Do Not Pay portal payment matches for items in need of adjudication. Flagged payments or payments listed as possible matches are reviewed with the respective HHS division making the payment before a determination is reported to Treasury on the portal. 

In FY 2023, the Department screened 1.1 million payments worth $723.9 billion against the Do Not Pay portal's death record databases. While 12 potential improper payments were initially identified, further investigation by HHS confirmed zero improper payments in FY 2023.  Additionally, CMS conducted checks on 1.1 billion payments, totaling $415.8 billion in FY 2023, against PIIA-listed databases outside of the DNP portal. Through these checks, CMS prevented 564,185 payments, resulting in savings of $2.2 billion.

"SSA","arp18","[arp18](Optional) Provide any additional information or context about the agency recoveries. (Unit- Free-Text)","Historically, our remittance process was a largely manual workload handled by the Mid-Atlantic Program Service Center (MATPSC).  The MATPSC remittance process requires a method of payment (check, money order, debit or credit card) and a corresponding payment coupon necessary to update a debtor’s record.  In fiscal year (FY) 2021, as part of the Debt Management Product, we implemented several improvements to our remittance process.  In FY 2021, we started accepting repayment of benefit overpayments through the Department of the Treasury’s (Treasury) Pay.gov via credit or debit card and automated clearing house (ACH); i.e., a checking or savings account.  In addition to this effort, we partnered with Treasury to use U.S. Bank, a financial agent for Treasury, to implement a lockbox service to assist with our paper remittance processing efforts at the MATPSC.  Lastly, we implemented Online Bill Pay (OLBP), allowing debtors to make a one-time or recurring ACH draft from a bank account using a personal computer or mobile phone.  These enhancements now account for nearly approximately 49.67 percent of our remittance activity.

During FY 2023, we extended the lockbox service to include Supplemental Security Income remittances.

In FY 2023, we processed over 464,000 remittances and collected nearly $94 million through Pay.gov; we processed approximately 216,000 remittances and collected over $54 million through the lockbox service; and we processed over 41,000 remittances and collected over $4 million through the OLBP.","2023"

"HUD","exs1","[exs1] Provide an executive summary of the payment integrity activities and results for the agency for this reporting period (SEE - 'Helpful Hint' - minimum length requirements vary depending on Agency status). (Unit - Free-Text)","HUD performed a comprehensive risk assessment of disbursements and programs based on FY 2022 payment data. Programs with outlays >$10M are risk assessed every 3 years; a total of 18 programs met this criteria.  As a result, no additional programs were identified as susceptible to significant improper payment. 

Prior year improper payment work identified the following two programs as susceptible to improper payments:
-Rental Housing Assistance Program (RHAP) - Tenant Based Rental Assistance (TBRA) Program
-RHAP - Project Based Rental Assistance (PBRA) Program

In FY 2023, HUD was unable to perform testing for Rental Housing Assistance Program-Tenant Based Rental Assistance (RHAP-TBRA) and Rental Housing Assistance Program – Project-Based Rental Assistance (RHAP-PBRA) due to the lack of available supporting  documentation at the TIER 2 level. Due to this scope limitation and guidance from OMB on 10/25/2022, HUD did not report improper payment estimates for rental assistance programs TBRA and PBRA as the full payment lifecycle could not be verified and testing was unable to be completed. HUD will not report an error rate for PBRA and TBRA for FY 2023 reporting cycle.

For FY24, HUD leadership is aware of the importance of payment integrity.  Consistent with executing the mission, HUD leadership will assess overall risk of payment integrity.

"HUD","ara2_3","[ara2_3]Provide a minimum of 3-5 sentences presenting the justification for the determination that it is not cost-effective to conduct recovery AUDITS in certain programs. (Unit - Free-Text)","I. Nature of the Program
A payment recapture audit was deemed not be cost-beneficial based on the nature of these programs. Collectability is a concern as tenants may no longer be receiving housing assistance when the overpayments are identified, or many may not be able to repay the subsidy with their own resources. HSNG Owners/ PIH PHAs use the Enterprise Income Verification (EIV) system to verify tenant employment/income information and reduce administrative and subsidy payment errors in accordance with HUD administrative guidance. The program Points of Contact (POC) use EIV to monitor the owner’s compliance with access and use of the system. However, tenant files are stored locally at each Multifamily property and some RHAP activities are administered by PHAs nationwide. A recovery audit would involve substantial travel costs in addition to staff time. There are also no centralized computer database capturing documents used to support the rental subsidy determinations. Therefore, the cost of any additional attempts to recover improper payments would exceed the benefit of improper payments recovered.

II. Lack of Empirical Evidence
The results of HUD’s payment integrity risk assessments identified these programs as not susceptible to significant improper payments. There is no empirical evidence, either through risk assessments, A-123 internal control reviews, and other monitoring reviews, that suggests significant improper payments exist within these programs and activities, and it is not likely that HUD would realize any benefit to payment recapture audits of these programs. Therefore, the cost of any additional attempts to recover improper payments would exceed the benefit of improper payments recovered.

III. Similar Overpayment Recovery Activities for CPD Programs
The CPD funds have a monitoring process in place to assess the quality of performance of the grantee over time and promptly resolve the findings of audits and other reviews. Monitoring provides information about program participants that is critical for making informed judgments about program effectiveness and management efficiency. It also helps in identifying instances of fraud, waste, and abuse. The process involves frequent telephone/email contacts, written communications, analysis of reports and audits, and periodic meetings. Monitoring also provides opportunities to identify program participant accomplishments as well as successful management/ implementation/evaluation techniques that might be replicated by other CPD program participants. 
Parties involved include Special Need Assistance Programs (SNAP), Field Offices, Office of Policy Development and Coordination (OPDC), Office of Rural Housing and Economic Development (ORHED), Office of General Counsel (OGC), Budget and OCFO. CPD’s program exhibit 34-1a, Guide for Review of Financial Management and Audits, is designed to monitor non-federal entity’s compliance with requirements of Subparts D and F of 2 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, except for cost allowability, procurement and equipment. During the monitoring process, program expenditures are reviewed to determine if improper payments were made. If identified CPD determines whether the appropriate corrective actions took place. In most cases, CPD will recapture overpayments by offsetting future draws. Overpayments in the Neighborhood Stabilization Program are addressed through reduction of future allocations as opposed to future draws. If there are no remaining funds on the grant, HUD will typically instruct the grantee to either repay funds from non-federal funds sources to their grant’s line of credit in Line of Credit Control System (LOCCS) or to the Treasury’s account if the grant has been closed. A remittance to the line of credit of less than $2,000 may be made by sending a check to HUD-FAD Collections Ft. Worth PO Box 6200-05, whereas any remittance of more than $2,000 must be sent via wire transfer to the Department of U.S. Treasury’s Financial Communications System (TFCS). CPD programs could also withhold additional funding until the overpayment has been recovered. 
In addition, the results of HUD’s payment integrity risk assessment identified these programs as not susceptible to significant improper payments. Therefore, the cost of any additional attempts to recover improper payments would exceed the benefit of improper payments recovered.

IV. Similar Overpayment Recovery Activities for Ginnie Mae Programs
For any overpayments identified, Ginnie Mae will either request reimbursement or offset future payments to the contractor. However, if there are no future invoices to be provided, Ginnie Mae will request reimbursement for the improper payment. To recover overpayments made to the General Services Administration (GSA) for invoice payments to a vendor, Ginnie Mae will process an IPAC. When the cost of recovering improper payments is greater than the benefits, then Ginnie Mae will not pursue any further actions than mitigating strategies as outlined already. 
As it relates to the Pass-Through Assistance Program (PTAP) program, which is new for 2021, the process for identifying improper payments includes validation of the request against the loan and pool information submitted to the Reporting and Feedback System (RFS), evaluation of the issuers equity and liquidity as reported with the PTAP request, and evaluation of the custodial account balance from which the Investor payments will be drawn.
The PTAP disbursement process is the same as in all Ginnie Mae disbursement requests. The PTAP disbursement request is processed for review and approval for payment. All payment requests are approved by an Independent Certifying Officer (ICO) (who accepts personal financial responsibility and criminal liability for improper payments they certify). The cost of recovering improper payments would exceed the benefit of improper payments recovered and would not be beneficial to the program.

V. Similar Overpayment Recovery Activities for Other Rental Assistance Programs
The results of HUD’s payment integrity risk assessment identified these programs as not susceptible to significant improper payments. All owners receiving funding from these programs are mandated by 24 CFR 5.233 to fully utilize HUD’s EIV system. EIV is a web-based application which provides owners with employment, wage, unemployment compensation and social security benefit information for tenants participating in HUD’s assisted housing programs. Tenant Rental Assistance Certification System (TRACS) is a system developed to improve the fiscal control over assisted housing programs and acts as the sole repository of all tenant certification data, assistance contract data and crucial payment data. EIV is matched against TRACS and a variance of $2,400 per year generates an error and owners are required to follow-up with the tenant and resolve the error. If an overpayment is identified, tenants may pay the owner in a lump sum or by entering into a repayment agreement. Therefore, the cost of any additional attempts to recover improper payments would exceed the benefit of improper payments recovered.

Of the thirty-seven (37) programs excluded from a Payment Recapture Audit, the remaining fifteen (15) programs have other mechanisms in place to recover overpayments.

In addition, the Commission oversees a payment recapture program that includes both audits and transaction testing to search for and recapture over payments.

The FCC's improper payments in each of its Phase 2 programs has come down significantly over the last 5 years.  

USF High Cost - The USF high cost program being the most complex program has made adjustments to its review procedures.  Additionally, on the recommendation of the FCC OIG and OMB, we split the high cost program into two distinctly separate programs, the high cost legacy program and the high cost modernized program.  A risk assessment was performed in FY21 on each of the programs. Through these risk assessment, it was determined that the high cost legacy program had significant risks and was subject to improper payments reporting.  However, the USF high cost modernized program was not subject to significant risks.  The FCC performed a statistically valid sample of the USF high cost legacy program and it was determined the estimated improper payments in the program amounted to 2.87% which was above the statutory limits. The FCC and USAC have reviewed the two major root causes in this program that are driving the improper payments (misclassification of assets and depreciation) estimate and are committed to working with carriers through outreach and training in order to reduce the improper payments below the statutory threshold.  

USF - Lifeline - This program has shown a significant reduction in improper payments estimates.  In FY17 the improper payment rate hit its peak of 21.93% and has significantly fallen since to 13.81% in FY20 to its lowest rate of 2.18% in the current reporting period.  The reason was clear to the FCC and USAC since there were a few opt-out states that are not required to follow the FCC rules for determining eligibility requirements through the National Verifier system. We had discussion with the state PUC's in these opt-out states explaining the importance of ensuring their controls and review processes were more in line with USAC's processes. The FCC and USAC's hard worked has paid off as we continue to enhance our controls to reduce improper payments even further.  

USF - Schools and Libraries -  The Schools and Libraries program continues to be above the statutory threshold of 1.5% of program outlays and $10 million.  Last fiscal year the error rate in the program increased by a little to 3.73%, however, for this current reporting period the improper payment error rate decreased to 1.59%.  As with the other programs that are reporting on improper payments, the FCC and USAC continuously review root causes in this program and competitive bidding along with invoicing errors continues to be the drivers of the improper payments error rate. The FCC in conjunction with our Administrator are in the process of making the necessary adjustments to the invoicing process and the competitive bidding requirements.  The FCC is committed to finding solutions to the root causes so that it is able to bring down the improper payment estimate even further. 

TRS - The Telecommunications Relay Service program was moved to phase 2 in FY22 due to a provider entering into a consent decree with the FCC due to a large overpayment which has now been recovered.  Through testing of transaction in the current year, TRS will move back to phase 1 due to their improper payments rate being below the statutory threshold for reporting on improper payments.

Throughout the years the the FCC has made great strides in updating its controls and oversight in its programs and strives to bring all programs back to phase 1 reporting. This has been a monumental undertaking by the FCC and its partners and we continue to make improvements each year.  The FCC takes seriously the recommendations provided by the OIG and its auditor so that our programs are in total compliance with the guidelines outlined in OMB M-21-19.

For Payroll, the EEOC conducted bi-weekly quality reviews of payroll actions and an annual audit of the payroll function in totality. EEOC is also developing an electronic tool to strengthen internal controls by identifying payroll discrepancies after the transactions have been processed. 

For Vendor and Travel Payments, testing was done in April 2023 for FY 2023 Quarters 1 and 2, and in October 2023 for the FY 2023 Quarters 3 and 4. The methodology utilized random sampling of 1% of the payment population in each category, with a 95% confidence level. There were no Improper Payments identified for either testing period.","2023"

Based on the low rate of improper payments, DOI concluded that the cost of executing a payment recapture audit program outweighed the benefits of finding and recovering erroneous payments. The staff resources needed to conduct the program, sustain the contract, and oversee vendor payments were a significant drain on limited agency resources with minimal benefits to the government. In April 2014, OMB was notified that DOI discontinued the payment recapture audit program. The DOI continues to have a low improper payment rate and circumstances have not changed within our programs to make a payment recapture audit cost effective. As such, DOI did not perform recapture audits for improper payments this fiscal year. The DOI will continue complying with PIIA through the OMB Circular A-123 process as a more cost effective and efficient use of agency resources to identify, reduce, and recover improper payments.","2023"

(Unit - Free-Text)","In FY 2023, AmeriCorps is in Phase 2 for AmeriCorps State and National, the AmeriCorps Seniors Foster Grandparent program, and the AmeriCorps Seniors Senior Companion program. The scope of testing includes grantee payments made in Q3 and Q4 of FY 2022 and Q1 and Q2 of FY 2023. None of the improper payments made are within the agency’s control and a majority of improper payments are due to inadequate record-keeping and calculation errors. AmeriCorps will reinstitute a corrective action plan committee to address these root causes in FY 2024.

The AmeriCorps State and National program had an increase in improper payment rates of 0.5 percent, which is attributable to variations in testing results from random samples. The improper payment rate is within the upper and lower bounds of the FY 2022 results and is not statistically significant.

AmeriCorps Seniors observed significant decreases in its Foster Grandparent and Senior Companion programs. These decreases were due to the phase out of COVID-19 related Temporary Pay Allowance, in which the agency observed significant gaps in documentation resulting in increases in improper payments in the past two fiscal years. In addition, there was a marked improvement in grantees using the agency-contracted vendors to perform National Service Criminal History Checks, reducing improper payments. Additionally, the agency instituted a regulation change in FY 2021 related to National Service Criminal History Checks, which resulted in a decrease in improper payments.

(Unit - Free-Text)","In FY 2023, the SBA has made great strides in our payment integrity efforts.  Although the SBA was found to be non-compliant with the Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) by the OIG in their FY 2023 PIIA Compliance Audit, the SBA continues to make payment integrity efforts and reducing improper payments a priority.  The SBA has already implemented several corrective actions to address the OIG recommendations, and are continuing our efforts to implement additional corrective action plans to address the remaining OIG recommendations with an anticipated closure date of May 2024 for all OIG recommendations identified during the FY 2023 PIIA Compliance audit.  

To further address risks related to improper payments, the SBA performs qualitative risk assessments on programs not reporting improper payment estimates to identify programs susceptible to significant improper payments.  The SBA's risk assessments are performed on a 3-year rotational basis with our last round of risk assessments completed in FY 2022.  In FY 2023, the SBA conducted one qualitative risk assessment for the Congressional Grants program and concluded the program was not susceptible to significant improper payments.  This program began reporting in Phase 1 in FY 2023.  Additionally, in anticipation of the potential risk of improper payments (and from non-compliances identified in the FY 2023 PIIA Compliance Audit), the SBA chose to proactively conduct improper payment testing on a statistical sample of the outlays for the Restaurant Revitalization Fund program and the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant program and are reporting improper payment estimates for these two programs in FY 2023.

On an annual basis, the SBA monitors programmatic activities by reviewing the outlays data for each SBA program to identify programs that had significant changes in outlays and/or programs that are now in Phase 1.  In FY 2023, a total of ten programs are in Phase 2.  Of the ten programs reporting in Phase 2, two programs are related to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) (PPP Loan Guaranty Purchases and PPP Loan Forgiveness), two are COVID-pandemic related programs that are new for this year (Restaurant Revitalization Fund (RRF) program and Shuttered Venue Operators Grant (SVOG) program), two are COVID-pandemic related programs that were introduced in FY 2022 (COVID-EIDL and EIDL Advance), and the remaining four are regular SBA programs.  In response to the FY 2023 PIIA Compliance audit, the SBA bifurcated out the PPP reporting into three reporting categories - PPP Approvals, PPP Forgiveness, and PPP Purchases.  Since the SBA is no longer issuing PPP loans, PPP Approvals was not reported on this year.  SBA has drafted and implemented CAPs related to each of the ten Phase 2 programs.

DOL had concerns about OIG's findings on these criteria as detailed in Management's Response to the OIG's draft report. 

In FY23 the Department of Labor (DOL) found three programs to be ""susceptible to significant improper payments (IP)"". These are 1) the Employment and Training Administration - Federal State Unemployment Insurance (UI) program, 2) the Employment and Training Administration - Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program, and 3) the Office of Workers' Compensation - Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) program. Despite having expired in law as of September 6, 2021 and no benefits were paid for weeks of eligibility in the current reporting period, two UI benefit programs created in response to the Pandemic, the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC) and the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC) both provide payment integrity reporting as part of the UI program.

The PUA program was determined ""susceptible"" in FY21. DOL submitted a Sampling and Estimation Methodology Plan (S&EMP) for estimating the PUA program’s improper payment rate and amount to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on June 30, 2022. In October 2022, OMB requested that DOL conduct further analysis of the outcomes recorded through the PUA case review process. OMB and DOL agreed to collaborate in conducting this additional analysis. In direct collaboration with OMB, the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) updated the PUA S&EMP. OMB accepted the update and DOL published information on the methodology and the IP estimation on August 21, 2023.

All Pandemic-related UI programs (PUA, PEUC, and FPUC) expired in law on September 6, 2021, though some states stopped offering these benefits prior to that date. None of these programs provided benefits for weeks of unemployment in FY23.  States continued to work backlogs adjudicating and paying benefits under these temporary program in the current reporting period.  However, the total outlays for the FPUC program were less than $10,000,000 , and thus no data is reported for this program. 

DOL conducts a program inventory annually and conducts risk assessments of all identified programs on a minimum triennial basis as required by M-21-19. No new DOL programs meeting the $10,000,000 threshold for reporting were identified in FY23, nor were any existing programs newly determined to be ""susceptible to significant IP"".

This marks the 9th time over the last 11 years, the EPA has been determined to be compliant with Payment Integrity statutes.

With the enactment of the Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act (IIJA) & Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the EPA has received over $100 billion in supplemental funding, which has created an unprecedented opportunity to advance agency efforts to protect human health and the environment and help the nation address challenges such as climate change, environmental justice, and strengthening our nation’s infrastructure. To ensure proper tracking and reporting of the IIJA and IRA resources, the agency has developed new account coding structures to precisely track dozens of new IIJA and IRA budget line items, enhanced our dashboards so managers and staff can efficiently access budget and financial data in real time, and improved oversight functions to identify major risks and controls to ensure proper stewardship of IIJA and IRA funding.

In the fourth quarter of FY 2023, the EPA completed off-cycle qualitative risk assessments of all programs and payment streams to address the unresolved, prior-year OIG compliance audit findings (June 27, 2022 compliance report) and consider the potentially increased risk as the agency had begun the disbursement of IIJA and IRA funds. The results of risk assessments showed that 8 of the agency’s 9 programs/payment streams were not likely to be susceptible to significant improper payments. One program (Grants) was determined to be potentially susceptible to significant improper payments, and as a result, the agency will conduct a statistical sample of the Grants Program's outlays to determine if it exceeds the statutory threshold for susceptibility. 

Due to the large increase in the agency funding, the EPA will undertake non-statistical payment reviews of its Contracts payment stream and increase the reviews of its Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds. Further, the EPA is reviewing the need for, and timing of, unique risk assessments by breaking out new programs resulting from the IRA funding.

From FY 2022 to FY 2023 the amount of confirm fraud the EPA identified dropped 99.8% (from $970,000 to $20,000). As a result, the agency reported $0.002M of confirmed fraud in this reporting cycle. Each fiscal year, information on the results of closed fraud cases, including the dollar amounts of identified fraud, are provided to agency via the OIG’s Office of Investigations which the EPA reports in the Agency Financial Report and on PaymentAccuracy.gov. Fraud investigations may take multiple years to come to a resolution resulting highly variable amounts from year to year.

In addition, the Treasury reclamation process is used once a receivable established to recover an overpayment has aged and can be referred for Treasury collection processing. DHS widely utilizes the accounts receivable process to generate a receivable that then prompts a collection notification process.

(Unit - Free-Text)","NASA remains committed to preventing and reducing improper payments through its Payment Integrity Improvement Program (PIIP). NASA annually conducts a Payment Integrity Risk Assessment and updates its risk assessment methodology to ensure proper assessment activities are conducted. Updates to the methodology are made as appropriate regarding changes to improper payment legislation and guidance, changes to NASA’s operating environment, recommendations from external auditors, and other circumstances. NASA performed its FY 2023 Payment Integrity Risk Assessment using the updated methodology, which incorporates seven risk conditions, each with a set of related criteria designed to account for the eleven OMB-designated risk factors. 

In M-21-19, OMB requires that each agency assess programs or activities deemed not susceptible to significant improper payments at least once every three years. NASA opted to assess all programs with outlays over $10 million this year, regardless of whether the program had been assessed in the previous two fiscal years. During off-cycle years, NASA will monitor programs for significant changes and new programs (including those previously under the $10 million threshold). If applicable, NASA will conduct an-off cycle assessment.

To conduct the risk assessment, NASA extracted the population ($25.5 billion) of FY 2022 disbursements from its financial management system to develop a list of all programs with outlays of at least $10 million for the FY 2023 Payment Integrity Risk Assessment. The universe of payments subject to analysis included disbursements to vendors, NASA employees, and other government agencies issued by NASA between October 1, 2021, and September 30, 2022. For the FY 2023 assessment, NASA conducted 86 assessments. None of the programs selected for assessment were found to be susceptible to significant improper payments.

NASA maintains payment integrity through strong internal controls including both preventative controls (e.g., payment approval processes) and detective controls (e.g., the continuous monitoring program). For FY 2022 (IG-23-013), the NASA Office of the Inspector General (OIG) concluded that NASA complied with PIIA.","2023"

"DOI","exs1","[exs1] Provide an executive summary of the payment integrity activities and results for the agency for this reporting period (SEE - 'Helpful Hint' - minimum length requirements vary depending on Agency status). (Unit - Free-Text)","On March 5, 2021, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued an update to Appendix C of Circular A-123 (Appendix C) in OMB Memorandum M-21-19 Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement. Appendix C requires agencies to review all programs and activities for the risk of improper payment by performing assessments to determine whether those programs are “susceptible to significant improper payments.” Due to the DOI’s historic low risk of improper payments, the DOI conducts comprehensive risk assessments on a three-year cycle of all agency programs with payments greater than $10 million during the assessment period (In Cycle Risk Assessment). With OMB concurrence, DOI utilizes an alternative annual assessment period from quarter 4 of the prior fiscal year through quarter 3 of the current fiscal year. 

In FY 2018, based upon OIG audit recommendations, the DOI launched a new SharePoint tool to assess the susceptibility of programs to significant improper payments utilizing a qualitative risk analysis. In FY 2021, DOI rebuilt the PIIA SharePoint consistent with OMB’s FY 2021 Appendix C update. For FY 2023, the DOI updated its SharePoint to utilize a risk-based approach when determining the weighting for each of the Interior and OMB risk factors, as noted within Appendix C. Risk weighting adjustment(s) may vary year over year and will be dependent on the current payment integrity operating environment, managements discretion, and risk management functions.

In FY 2023, DOI completed an Off-Cycle Appendix C Phase 1 Risk Assessment of new DOI programs as well as those on a three-year IP risk assessment cycle experiancing a significant change in legislation and/or a significant increase in its funding level. the Risk Assessment included programs funded through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) with over $10 million in outlays for the assessment period of Quarter 4 of FY 2022 through Quarter 3 of FY 2023 (assessment period). A total of fourteen (14) program risk assessments were performed in the PIIA SharePoint, with a total of $1.94 billion in outlays for the assessment period. None of the 14 risk assessments performed in FY 2023 resulted in a program being identified as being at high risk of susceptibility to significant improper payments, with no new programs requiring Appendix C Phase 2 Testing in FY 2024. 

Sampling and Estimation:

DOI is required to design and implement appropriate statistical sampling and estimation methods to produce statistically valid improper payment estimates for all programs and activities determined to be “susceptible to significant improper payments” through Appendix C Phase 2 Testing. DOI employs a testing methodology using statistical sampling to estimate the amount and percentage of improper payments based on the prior year’s program expenditures. In developing its sampling and estimation plans, DOI consults with a certified statistician to ensure its testing methodology will produce statistically valid improper payment estimates. 

DOI's Appendix C internal controls and monitoring over the payment process in FBMS and GrantSolutions business and payment systems are reviewed on a regular basis and remain effective.  The minimal amount of overpayments across all agency programs, when DOI programs funded under the “emergency supplemental appropriations to respond to and recover from recent hurricanes, wildfires, and other disasters” (DRA program) underwent Phase 2 Testing for 2019 expenditures in 2020 resulted in an overall error rate of 0.07 percent with a statistically estimated $.0185 million in improper payments against total program outlays of $27.44 million. These results were achieved with a precision rate of 1.58% with a 95% confidence level. The testing of the DRA program established a baseline improper payment rate of 0.07 percent for this program, significantly below the statutory threshold required for continued Phase 2 Testing of the program. Consistent with Section II.C.3. of Appendix C (see Table 2 and page 19 of M-21-19). DOI is committed to continuing to enhance its OMB A-123 internal control procedures and to established risk reduction measures that are both appropriate and effective.","2023"

"SBA","ara2_3","[ara2_3]Provide a minimum of 3-5 sentences presenting the justification for the determination that it is not cost-effective to conduct recovery AUDITS in certain programs. (Unit - Free-Text)","On September 15, 2011, the SBA submitted a Payment Recapture Audit Cost-Effective Analysis to the Office of Management and Budget. The analysis discussed the 7(a) Business Loan Guaranty Program, the 504 Certified Development Company Loan Guaranty Program, the Disaster Direct Loan Program, Disbursements for Goods and Services, the Small Business Investment Company Financing Guaranty Program, the Surety Bond Guaranty Program, and Grants, which included all grant programs. The analysis described the program, the controls over financial disbursements, and the size of the program and concluded for each program that recapture audits would not be cost effective due to low error rates, complexity of the program, or limited amount of outlays. A subsequent cost analysis for the 7(a) loan guaranty purchase program was submitted to OMB on September 13, 2017, to include the results of a payment recapture audit performed in 2015, which again concluded that such an audit is not cost effective. In FY 2022, the SBA performed a cost-benefit analysis for programs with over $1 million in disbursements and not covered by the analysis completed in 2011, and concluded that it would not be cost-effective to perform a recovery audit. Some of the factors considered include the following: program was not identified as being susceptible to significant improper payments in the last risk assessment, there have been no recent audit findings or reports to suggest that the program is susceptible to improper payments, prior internal control assessments did not identify the program as being susceptible to significant improper payments, and the cost to perform a recovery audit exceeded the potential recovery amount. 

In FY 2023, the SBA did not conduct any recovery audits. As mentioned above, in prior years, the SBA has conducted cost-benefit analyses on programs subject to payment recapture audit, and deemed the costs to perform a payment recapture audit outweighed the benefits of the audit. 

In lieu of recovery audits, for programs currently reporting improper payment estimates, the improper payment review testing and results from the testing were leveraged to identify potential payments that could be recovered.  In addition to that, there are also other reviews (internal control assessments, post-award reviews, monthly QA reviews, cost compliance reviews, etc.) conducted on those programs that are outside of the recovery audit process that were also leveraged to identify improper payments.  

Although recovery audits are not performed, the SBA does conduct recovery activities for improper payments identified outside of the recovery audit process.   For example, on 7(a) loan guaranty approvals, overpayments identified in the improper payments review are recaptured from the lender, on disaster direct loans and COVID-EIDL loans, overpayments identified are recovered through loan modifications, on EIDL advances, overpayments can be recovered via fund offsets or referral to OIG, for PPP loans, overpayments can be recovered through loan modifications and repayment, for RRF awards, overpayments are recovered via demand letters sent to awardees, and for SVOG, overpayments are recovered through demand letters, and Treasury debt cross-servicing.","2023"

OPM's Inspector General concluded that the agency was compliant with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) in the most recent compliance audit.  

PIIA requires the agency to review and assess all programs and activities with annual outlays greater than $10,000,000 for improper payment risk at least once every three years to identify those susceptible to significant improper payments.    OPM conducts improper payment risk assessments on a three-year cycle, or more often if there are significant changes in the program.  In FY 2023 OPM conducted improper payments risk assessments for three programs.  One of those programs is now a phase 2 program due to the amount of program outlays.  OPM now has two phase 2 programs, one of these programs, Retirement Services (RS) is reporting an improper payment estimate.  

OPM's Retirement Services improper and unknown rate is 0.38 percent.  The improper payment rate is 0.35 percent.  The tolerable rate is 0.38 percent. RS is aware of the improper payment drivers; however, systemic limitations prevent RS from providing the survey's requested level of specificity. OPM’s systems were not designed or built to perform analyses of vast quantities of data.  There are overpayments that are the result of annuitant's family members and other sources failing to report annuitant's death.  However, as our on-going internal control activities, OPM conducts surveys and matches to mitigate potential improper payments resulting from these events. OPM conducts two matches to identify discrepancies that may exist between the OPM annuity roll and the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) pay system. The Consolidated Death Match (CDM) is compared with OPM’s annuity roll weekly to identify annuitants who are reported as deceased by SSA. The Validated Agency Match System processes the death information in order to terminate Federal benefits and prevent subsequent improper payments. Collection actions are initiated for any overpayments that are discovered. The SSA Death Master File (DMF) match is conducted yearly and is also compared with OPM’s annuity roll and the SSA Death Master File (DMF). OPM also utilizes Treasury's Do Not Pay Portal to identify annuitants that should have been reported as deceased.

(Unit - Free-Text)","Over the past decade, laws and regulations governing the identification and recovery of improper payments have evolved to strengthen improvements in payment accuracy and raise public confidence in Federal programs. The Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA), as amended and expanded by other related laws, collectively required agencies to periodically review all programs and activities to identify those susceptible to significant improper payments, to conduct payment recapture audits, and to leverage Government-wide Do Not Pay initiatives. The IPIA regulations also required extensive reporting requirements. OMB transformed the improper payment compliance framework to create a more unified, comprehensive, and less burdensome set of requirements. IPIA was repealed and replaced by the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA), which was passed on March 2, 2020. The PIIA modified and restructured existing improper payments laws to help agencies better identify and reduce any money wasted as a result of improper government payments. Not all improper payments are fraud, and not all improper payments represent a loss to the government. Generally, an improper payment is any payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount under a statutory, contractual, and administrative or other legally applicable requirement. 
The Department defines its programs and activities in alignment with the manner of funding received through appropriations, as further subdivided into funding for operations carried out around the world. Risk assessments over all programs are done every three years. In the interim years, risk assessments evaluating programs that experience any significant legislative changes and/or significant increase in funding will be done to determine if the Department continues to be at low risk for making significant improper payments at or above the threshold levels set by OMB. The Department conducted a risk assessment of all programs and activities in 2022 and 2023 was the second year of the three year cycle. In 2023, the following programs included: American Compensation; Voluntary Contributions; Temporary Duty Travel; Diplomatic and Support Programs; Worldwide Security Protection; International Security and Nonproliferation Programs; Population Refugees and Migration Programs; and Educational Programs. After performing risk assessments for these programs, the Department determined that none of its programs in 2023 were risk-susceptible for making significant improper payments at or above the threshold levels set by OMB. 
Annually, the Department submits data to OMB that is collected and presented on https:// paymentaccuracy.gov/ by individual agency or on a Government-wide consolidated basis. This website contains current and historical information about improper payments made under Federal programs, as well as extensive information about how improper payments are defined and tracked.

The information presented in this report complies with guidance provided in the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019; OMB Circular A-136, and Appendix C to OMB Circular A-123, M21-19, Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement.  

 

The guidance requires agencies to assess every Federal program with annual outlays greater than $10 million dollars, at least triennially, for improper payment risk, measure the accuracy of payments annually, and initiate program improvements to ensure payment integrity.  On November 20, 2009, Executive Order 13520, Reducing Improper Payments and Eliminating Waste in Federal Programs, was issued for the purpose of intensifying efforts to eliminate payment error, waste, fraud, and abuse in the major programs administered by the Federal government, while continuing to ensure that the right people receive the right payment for the right reason at the right time.  The supporting website, https://paymentaccuracy.gov/, contains the following information:  

Current and historical rates and amounts of improper payments for Federal agencies;  

Why improper payments occur; and  

What agencies are doing to reduce and recover improper payments.  

Program Review  

The STB has only one program for budget purposes.  The FY 2023 appropriated funding for the program is $41.429 million.  All the agency’s transactions are either employee payroll and benefits, intragovernmental, or non-Federal transactions.  

 

The STB does not maintain its own financial management system but uses a shared service provider, ESC, to process all accounting transactions and the DOI processes payroll and benefits.  ESC is subject to external audit in accordance with the Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) 18, Attestation Standards: Clarification and Recodification.  The STB examines the SSAE No. 18 audit results annually to determine if the shared service provider’s internal controls are operating effectively.  The Board also evaluates the internal controls required to supplement the shared service provider’s controls as outlined in the SSAE 18.  

 

Intra-governmental transactions, accounts payables, and payments to agency employees are reviewed as part of the agency’s internal control program under OMB Circular A-123, Appendix A, Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Appendix C, Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement.  

 

Based on OMB Circular A-123, the STB’s program was reviewed to identify those activities that were susceptible to significant improper payments.  For FY 2023, the STB Federal and non-Federal payment was $14 million, and payroll was $26.4 million for a combined total of $40.4 million.  The Payment Integrity Information Act defines “significant” as either (1) improper payments that exceed both $10 million and 1.5% of program disbursements; or (2) improper payments in excess of $100 million.  Significant improper payments in the STB’s program needed to exceed both $0.6 million (1.5% improper payment rate) and $10 million of all non-Federal payments and payments to Federal employees.  No material improper payments were identified by the STB in FY 2023 for significant improper payment reporting. 

 

In addition, the following risk factors, likely to contribute to improper payments, were applied to the STB’s appropriated funds.   

Any new programs or activity in the agency.  

Complexity of the activity with respect to correct payments amounts.  

Volume of payments made annually.  

Recent major changes in activity funding, authority, practice, or procedures.  

Level, experience, and quality of training for personnel responsible for certifying that payments are accurate.  

Inherent risks of improper payments due to the nature of agency operations.  

Significant deficiencies in the audit reports of the agency that included Inspector General audit findings or external financial audit findings.  

Results from prior improper payment work.  

In FY 2023, zero (-) improper payments were discovered.  The STB will continue evaluating its programs based on identified risk factors to prevent improper payments from occurring, but the overall risk is low/not significant.  

Improper Payments Strategy  

The Payment Integrity Information Act requires agencies to conduct payment recapture audits with respect to each program and activity of the agency with expenditures of $1 million or more annually, if conducting such audits would be cost-effective.  The STB addresses proper management of payments by: 

preventing payment errors through documented processes and internal controls; and 

detecting overpayment and underpayments through control testing. 

Due to the STB’s limited staffing levels for its accounting and financial reporting functions, such support services are provided under contract with ESC.  Coordinating with ESC has greatly enhanced the STB's capabilities for identification of improper payments using detailed internal controls at both the STB and ESC.  The STB obtains contracting support from DOT, which follows established pre-enrollment, preaward, and pre-payment processes for all acquisition awards.  Preenrollment procedures include cross referencing applicants against the GSA System for Award Management (SAM) exclusion records.  ESC reviews Federal and commercial databases to verify past performance, Federal government debt, integrity, and business ethics.  For prepayment processes, ESC verifies an entity against both SAM and the Internal Revenue Service’s Taxpayer Identification Number Match Program before establishing the entity as a vendor in its core financial accounting system. 

Recapture of Improper Payments Reporting  

The Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 requires agencies to conduct recovery audits with respect to each program and activity of the agency that expends $1 million or more annually, if conducting such audits would be cost-effective.  

Once the STB has identified an improper payment with a non-Federal vendor, it is STB’s policy to aggressively correct the improper payment.  Upon research and analysis of supporting documentation, the vendor is contacted for resolution (in the case of underpayment to the agency).  If the contract is ongoing, the Board will offset the amount to be recovered on the next billing.  For all other contracts, the vendor is contacted, and a receivable is established for collection.  If the vendor does not provide payment, the debt is entered into the Treasury Offset Program.  If an improper payment is identified as an overpayment to the STB, the vendor is promptly paid.","2023"

Administrative Offices - Other Contractual Services 
Program Offices - Other Contractual Services
The Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) Administrative and Budget Services manages Transit Subsidy payments. 
For the Payroll, Benefits and Retirement Division (PBRD), OCHCO reviews the unpaid report to ensure all HUD employees are paid based on their certified timecard for the Personnel Office Identifier (POI) 4408. If erroneous payments were made due to an error in personnel and benefits, OCHCO then takes the necessary action(s) to rectify the mistake. For example, OCHCO collaborates with the BFS and the Department of Agriculture’s National Finance Center (NFC) to run all the necessary reports to determine where the discrepancy was made. Once the source has been identified, OCHCO corrects the issue or determines if it is feasible to correct the improper payment. Through the PBRD quality review process, overpayments are identified and validated. Once validated and corrected through the NFC database, the debt is generated, and the employee is notified of the indebtedness. After due process, the collection process is initiated.
Also, the Human Resources (HR) Division performs a quality review based on the personnel data generated from the NFC FOCUS report or NFC Reporting Center application for personnel and benefits actions. The report data is used to determine if there are any incorrect coverage plans, personnel data or duty locations which will cause an overpayment for the employee. If so, the History Correction Update Processing (HCUP) system is used to correct the error, which will automatically generate a bill if it is within twenty-six (26) pay periods. Outside of the pay period timeframe, HR will manually calculate the amount owed and enter the data to be submitted to NFC via the Special Payroll Processing System (SPPS). The employee will be informed of the indebtedness; and have an opportunity to setup a payment plan.
The Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) provides assistance and advice to HUD program budget offices on improper payroll payments and payroll corrections on an ad-hoc basis and upon request. For other than payroll payments such as travel payments, purchase card payments, contract payments, and Interagency Agreement (IAA) payments, program offices follow the Administrative Control of Funds Policies (Administrative Control of Funds Policies, 1830.2 REV-6) to ensure improper payments are prevented or detected and corrected and OCFO-Budget provides assistance to budget offices upon request. Reports run from HUD’s Financial System (Oracle Business Intelligence/OBI) suite of reports to include the Procurement Request Information System Management (PRISM) and Travel reports, and other payment systems (e.g., Invoice Processing Platform (IPP), Intra.gov, Concur), are used to identify, and sometimes, recover improper non-payroll Salaries and Expenses (S&E) payments. Most program offices have designated individuals to run and review payment reports for discrepancies and improper payments including unauthorized purchases in line with departmental and program office funds control policies. Additionally, program office Contracting Officer Representatives (CORs) ensure invoice payments are proper and made in line with contract guidelines through the use of reports ran through IPP and related OBI reports.
As part of the bi-weekly payroll projection process, OCFO-Budget runs reports from OBI’s repository of payroll reports and flags any payroll corrections or unusual payroll activities for program budget offices. Upon request and on an ad-hoc basis, OCFO-Budget provides assistance in the correction of improper payroll payments by running reports from OBI’s repository of payroll reports (Cost and Hours report) and providing data regarding payroll corrections to program budget offices and Treasury’s ARC.
Additionally, program Budget office’s work with ARC, HUD OCFO, and HUD’s OCPO HUD CPO in the payment recapture process as it relates to non-payroll S&E improper payments. For example, program budget office’s work with OCFO’s travel management staff on the recapture of improper payments.
The Administrative Control of Funds Policies Handbook outlines procedures and points to additional guidance program offices follow that can lead to the identification, recovery, and prevention of future improper payments.

Lead Hazard Reduction
During grant execution, the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH) reviews grantee invoices, vouchers and supporting documentation. If an improper payment is identified, the Government Technical Representative (GTR) or the COR, as applicable, provides fund recipients with documentation of the determination of the improper payment, the regulatory, grant-specific, and/or contractual basis for recovering the improper payment, a due date for recoupment, and a due-process opportunity to appeal. The appeal, if made, goes to the Grants Division Director (for grants) or the COR (for contracts), as applicable. Should the request not be appealed, or the appeal denied, and the funding recipient did not refund the improper payment, the matter would be referred to the OGC for action. 
During the close-out of a grant, if it is determined that a financial error occurred, the grantee is asked to provide an explanation for the problem and, if required by the GTR, the grantee submits a check to resolve the financial shortfall. The COR forwards the check and a letter of explanation to the Budget Officer for the recapturing of funds. 
In addition, the GTR includes a copy of the check and the letter of explanation with the close-out package to the Grants Officer. The Grants Officer documents the returned funds on form HUD-1044 (Assistance Award/Assistance). OLHCHH’s process assures quality spending and monitoring for reimbursable funding. The likelihood of improper reimbursements are low due to several reasons. OLHCHH is a reimbursement program; the funds distributed are for services that have already been completed and invoiced. Additionally, every three months, grantees submit information on work performed and provide a financial statement using the Federal Financial Report (SF-425), HUD-Part 3 Budget form, and supporting documentation. The SF-425, HUD-Part 3 Budget form, and the LOCCS VRS Request Voucher for Grant Payment (form HUD-27053) must match data in LOCCS and all totals must be the same. Under remote monitoring, a GTR performs a review to ensure accuracy, as needed. On-site monitoring is conducted once a year after a risk analysis is completed and/or high-risk is determined for each grantee. Poor performing grantees are required to submit weekly or monthly reports. During grant execution, the OLHCHH reviews grantee invoices, vouchers and supporting documentation.

The Office of Housing-Federal Housing Administration’s (HSNG–FHA) recovery audit program is part of its overall program of effective internal control over payments. Internal control policies and procedures establishes a system to monitor improper payments and their causes, and includes controls and actions for detecting, preventing, and recovering improper payments. On a recurring basis, these programs generate reports that identify potentially duplicate disbursements. These disbursements are researched, and recovery actions are initiated for payments deemed improper. As part of the recapture audit plan, internal control documents and files are reviewed, and post claim reviews are performed. 
Under Title I and Other Debt Collection Guidance Handbook 4740.2, the Financial Operation Center (FOC) is primarily responsible for generic debt collection and customer service activities, including responding to debtor inquiries regarding pay-off, payment plans, compromises, disputes, and appeals. The debt referral package primarily consists of copies of legal documents, mortgages, deeds of trust, judgments and other recorded lien documents, lien assignment documents, repayment agreements, credit reports, correspondence to/from debtors, and compromise agreements and supporting documents. 
The Debt Collection Asset Management System (DCAMS) is the application used to support the generic debt collection process. DCAMS is designed to automatically send collection letters, report delinquent debt to credit bureaus and HUD’s Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System (CAIVRS), assess penalties and administrative costs, and refer eligible debts to the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) and Cross-Servicing. Based on predefined criteria and the status of that case as reflected in DCAMS data fields (not later than 180 days after the demand letter), DCAMS is consistently updated to prevent improper referral for TOP offset. 
For internal offsets, over-claimed amounts (negative claims) occur when the mortgagee owes FHA. The Single-Family Claims Branch (SFCB) sends billing letters to lenders for the excess amounts claimed and tracks the receivables using the Accounts Receivables Sub-system (ARS). Receivables are established in SFCB’s ARS and identified by an FHA case number. Each FHA case number is further identified by Section of the Act (which is linked to the appropriate fund) and endorsement date. This later date identifies the cohort year. The Holder of record to which the claim funds were originally disbursed is identified in ARS as the debtor, by default. When the receivable is subsequently liquidated by funds remitted by a Mortgagee or by offset, the collected amount is posted to the previously identified FHA case number, Section of the Act, and cohort year. 
If a payment is not received from a lender within 90 days, the receivable is offset against subsequent claims by the lender until the full amount of the receivable is satisfied. If a receivable is not satisfied within 120-150 days, it is referred to the FOC in Albany, NY for enforced collection actions. At that time, the FOC officially confirms acceptance of the transfer of an aged delinquent debt, and that receivables have been removed from the ARS with the notation that it has been referred to the FOC for recovery. 
Another avenue by which improper payments are recaptured is through Post Claim Reviews for title II Single Family Insurance Claims. A statistical sample of settled claims is reviewed for compliance with FHA servicing and claim filing requirements. A report on findings, is prepared and issued to the individual mortgagee. Mortgagees can refute the findings by providing additional documents before a final report is issued. If the Mortgagee chooses to pay the monetary findings prior to HUD’s issuance of the final report, those funds are deposited to ARS, which applies them to the Mortgage Insurance (MI) fund. Upon issuance of the final report, it is referred to the FOC which establishes it as a receivable and tracks it until paid in full. If a lender is overpaid on a Multifamily claim, the Multifamily Claims Branch will demand the overage back from the lender. If the lender fails to respond to their demands, the debt is referred to the FOC for collection. Lastly, for Treasury Cross-Servicing, the collection of generic debt is governed by the Debt Collection Improvement Act and HUD policies (Title I and Other Debt Collection Guidance 4740.2). The Act requires federal agencies to refer eligible delinquent debts to Treasury (for Cross-Servicing and TOP) when the debt is 120 days delinquent. 
The Treasury’s TOP allows federal agencies to report delinquent non-tax debt to the BFS. BFS performs computer matching with disbursement data and processes an offset when an appropriate match is determined. After referral, Treasury and its private collection agencies are responsible for contacting the debtor to collect the payment of the debt. The Treasury’s Cross-Servicing is a process used by BFS to refer the debt collection to a private collection agency, among other actions, to collect delinquent debts on behalf of Federal Agencies. 
The FOC’s recapture process establishes receivables in DCAMS and issues a demand notice to the debtor(s). If the debt remains unpaid, DCAMS issues a “Notice of Intent” warning regarding enforced collection measures and informs the debtor regarding their due process rights. DCAMS automatically reports information to credit bureaus and CAIVRS. Penalty and administrative cost charges are also automatically assessed if warranted. 
If the debt remains unpaid, it is referred to Treasury (within 180 days) for offset via the government-wide TOP and for direct collection action by Treasury and Treasury contracted private collection agencies. Treasury also initiates referral to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for civil litigation and/or initiates Administrative Wage Garnishment (AWG) action if they deem such action to be appropriate. 
If Treasury’s Cross-Servicing action is not successful, Treasury “returns” the debt to the FOC. If older than two years, the receivable is written-off and the case is reclassified “currently not collectible.” The FOC keeps the case open if offset via TOP appears fruitful or if other collection measures are applicable (e.g., AWG action by HUD). Otherwise, the FOC terminates collection action, closes the case, and the system issues an IRS Form 1099C “Cancellation of Debt,” the following January if appropriate. Write-off, Termination, close-out, and 1099C issuance can also occur at any point in the above collection cycle if determined appropriate (e.g., debtor is discharged as bankrupt). 
Collections from debtors to HUD go to the Treasury Lockbox Network or Pay.gov. Collections from debtors to Treasury or DOJ come to HUD via interagency transfer (i.e., Intra-Governmental Payment and Collection (IPAC)). No matter the route, all payments are posted to the receivable in DCAMS.","2023"

(Unit- Free-Text)","The agency employs several methods to recover improper payments identified in recovery audits across various programs:

Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) Recovery Audits: CMS recovers improper payments by issuing demand letters to providers. These letters request repayment of the identified amounts owed. The agency has the option to offset the owed amount from future payments made to the provider. Alternatively, the provider can voluntarily submit a refund to the Medicare Administrative Contractor to rectify the improper payment.

Medicare Part C: To recover Part C overpayments in Medicare Advantage Organizations, the primary strategy is to conduct Contract-level Risk Adjustment Data Validation audits. These audits involve reviewing medical records to confirm the accuracy of diagnoses submitted by Medicare Advantage Organizations for risk-adjusted payments.  CMS anticipates initiating overpayment recovery actions for Contract-level Risk Adjustment Data Validation audits in FY 2024.

Medicare Part D: The agency identifies improper payments in Part D through an analysis of Prescription Drug Event Records that were not eligible for Medicare Part D coverage. Audits focus on high-risk and high-cost drugs, and Part D sponsors are notified of improper payments that need to be recouped unless supporting documentation is provided.

Medicaid Recovery Audit Contractors: State-run programs handle the recovery of Medicaid overpayments, and CMS does not have operational control over their efforts.

Medicare Secondary Payer Recovery Audit Contractor: For identifying improper payments related to Medicare as the secondary payer, the Recovery Audit Contractor issues a demand letter, notifying debtors of the debt's existence and including claim-specific information. Debtors are given instructions on how to repay or dispute the debt and are informed of the consequences of failing to resolve it within the specified timeframe. Interest is assessed on any unresolved balance after 60 days, and if the debt remains unresolved, it may be referred to the Department of the Treasury for collection.

The subsequent review performed by OMA focuses on overpayments and utilizes data and risk analysis to drive the recapture work performed. While many agencies hire external recapture auditors to perform a secondary review, this function is performed more efficiently within the Department by OMA. Because the OMA activity is secondary and consistent with a function that an external auditor would perform, OMA’s activity is considered recapture as defined by PIIA.

Domestic vendor payments represent the largest category of Department-made payments subject to PIIA recapture audit requirements. OMA utilizes several processes that focus on identifying potential improper and duplicate payments. Monthly, as part of the Recapture Audit process, OMA conducts a query of domestic vendor payments using software to run matches of vendor invoice numbers and payment amounts against current payment data and payments from the last 5 years. The CGFS automated duplicate payment program using the domestic payment file for recapture audit analysis has proven to be a cost-effective tool.

In making this determination, the Commission considered its low improper payment rate based on testing conducted over the previous three years and determined that the costs of implementing and overseeing a payment recapture audit program, including staff time and payments to contractors, would exceed any benefits or recaptured amounts that might result.

The Commission utilizes cost-efficient matching techniques to review all vendor payments to identify significant overpayments at a low cost per overpayment. The Commission has not identified a significant number or amount of improper payments since it began its analysis. In addition to contract payments, recapture auditing may also be considered for the Commission’s monetary awards to whistleblowers, if determined to be cost-effective, when payments to whistleblowers total more than $10 million annually. The amount of whistleblower awards will vary depending on the number and amount of covered enforcement actions in a given year, as well as the extent of original information provided by whistleblowers that led to the actions. However, the Commission has determined that implementing a payment recapture audit program for monetary awards to whistleblowers would not be cost-effective due to the effective design and operation of the internal controls in place for the program.

CFTC’s other most significant  payments are for monetary awards to eligible whistleblowers who voluntarily provided the CFTC with original information about violations of the CEA that led the CFTC to bring enforcement actions that resulted in monetary sanctions exceeding $1 million.  However, in FY 2023, CFTC disbursed only $670,000 to a handful of whistleblowers. Even in years when CFTC disburses millions of dollars in whistleblower payments, the review of each individual award by the Commission’s Claims Review Staff as well as multiple approval levels limit the likelihood that the whistleblower award program would be susceptible to significant improper payments.

(Unit - Free-Text)","The decision not to conduct recovery audits in the Advance Payments of the Premium Tax Credit (APTC) program is justified based on several key factors. First, the requirement for consumers to reconcile APTC payments at the time of tax filing inherently mitigates the risk of overpayment. This means that any discrepancies or overpayments can be rectified during the annual tax return process, reducing the need for recovery audits to recoup funds.

Second, the utilization of data matching programs with various Federal agencies during the eligibility determination process significantly enhances the accuracy and integrity of the application process. These data matching procedures ensure that the personal information provided by applicants aligns with known data, reducing the potential for fraud or abuse.

Considering these factors, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has found that the combination of the reconciliation process and robust data matching practices effectively minimizes the risk of improper payments and fraud, making it unnecessary to allocate resources for recovery audits in the APTC program at this time. This decision is both fiscally responsible and practical, ensuring that resources are directed towards areas where they are needed most.

The Administration for Children & Families (ACF) is a division of the Department of Health & Human Services.

"DOD","exs1","[exs1] Provide an executive summary of the payment integrity activities and results for the agency for this reporting period (SEE - 'Helpful Hint' - minimum length requirements vary depending on Agency status). (Unit - Free-Text)","The Department of Defense (DoD or the Department) met the overarching intent of the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-123, Appendix C by making Payment Integrity a top management priority in developing effective methodologies to help identify, prevent, and recover improper payments. The Department sustained the five out of six PIIA compliance criteria in the PIIA Compliance Audit. 

The Department's payment integrity portfolio comprises 16 separate programs evenly split between Phase 1 and Phase 2. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Travel Pay, and USACE Commercial Pay, and Military Health Benefits (MHB) – Administrative are three Phase 1 programs that delivered comprehensive fiscal year (FY) 2023 risk assessments that resulted in low susceptibility of significant Improper (IP) and Unknown Payments (UP). The remaining five newly established Phase 1 programs are MHB-TRICARE East Region Program (East), MHB-TRICARE West Region Program (West), MHB-TRICARE Medicare Eligible Program (TMEP), MHB-TRICARE Pharmacy Program (TPharm), and MHB-TRICARE Overseas Program (TOP). The Department will deliver those completed risk assessments on or prior to June 30, 2024. The Department will deliver those completed risk assessments on or prior to June 30, 2024. The Department has the following Phase 2 programs: Civilian Pay, Commercial Pay, Military Pay – Army, Military Pay – Navy, Military Pay – Department of the Air Force, Military Pay - Marine Corps, Military Retirement, and DoD Travel Pay.

For FY 2023, the Department identified three programs as high priority: Military Health Benefits, Military Retirement, and DoD Travel Pay.  The Department successfully closed out all three OMB high priority programs in FY 2023 by reducing monetary losses and restructuring programs to better align with program objectives.  Furthermore, the Department prevented all the Phase 2 programs from becoming a high priority program in FY 2024 through its continued efforts to identify error root causes, to focus on controls that detect and prevent overpayments, to implement or reinforce applicable processes and procedures, and to train staff on policy guidance and best practices.

The FY 2023 IP and UP results were developed using a revised statistical methodology to test more high-risk payment samples, because of a DoD Office of Inspector General (OIG) recommendation.  The overarching goal is to achieve PIIA compliance specifically, compliance criteria #3 to “publish IP and UP estimates for programs susceptible to significant IPs and UPs in the accompanying materials to the annual financial statement.  The Department’s Phase 2 programs have established a baseline and three programs (Military Pay - Navy, Military Pay – Department of the Air Force, Military Pay - Marine Corps) reported IP plus UP estimates below the OMB statutory threshold.  Therefore, achieving a positive determination on PIIA compliance criteria #3 would automatically move those Phase 2 programs to Phase 1 and place them on a three-year risk assessment cycle beginning in FY 2024. This is a significant accomplishment for the Department and for the specific Military Branches.

In an ongoing effort to improve Payment Integrity reporting for the MHB payment portfolio, the MHB – Healthcare program’s IP and UP Risk Assessment resulted in a determination to reorganize and restructure the remaining payments not covered under administrative costs into groups with similar contractual requirements or performance incentives.  The MHB - Healthcare program reorganized into five separate programs in FY 2023 based on the different TRICARE contracts that process the beneficiary medical claims.  The five programs were designated as Phase 1 in order to perform comprehensive risk assessments to determine their accurate susceptibility to IP and UP based on their inherent and unique characteristics.  The Department is currently performing the new MHB Phase 1 program risk assessments to determine the susceptibility to IP and UP. The DoD OIG Payment Integrity audit team is in agreement with the MHB portfolio reorganization efforts. This allows the Department to focus our resources on identifying the true underlying IP specific to MHB contractual requirements opposed to the previous universal methodology for healthcare.  The Department is confident in this way forward to streamline MHB PIIA compliance

The Department has worked diligently to identify $1,735.66 million in monetary losses and recovered $1,711.09 million, which demonstrates proper stewardship of funding through the Department’s Payment Recovery Audits and Activities program.

(Unit- Free-Text)","The Department of State reviewed potential improper payments provided by the Department of the Treasury as a result of submitting disbursed payments through the Do Not Pay (DNP) portal. In 2023, the Treasury reviewed and disbursed 1,473,286 payments totaling $16.5 billion paid by the Department through the DNP portal. Potential matches were provided on a daily basis, comparing payments to the public Death Master File (DMF) of the Social Security Administration and the General Services Administration’s Excluded Parties List System (EPLS). Through daily access via the Treasury DNP portal, the Department reviewed 170,708 unmatchable payments, totaling $1.2 billion, and adjudicated 151 potential erroneous payment matches totaling $639 thousand as part of the post payment review process. 

The Department continued to utilize the DNP portal’s DMF on a pre-payment basis for all annuitant payments. At least twice each month the Department’s annuitant database is screened against the DMF to identify deceased annuitants. All matches are researched and if confirmed, payment to the annuitant is stopped prior to processing the monthly annuity payment run. In 2023, there were 204,870 annuitant payments totaling $1.1 billion were reviewed against the DMF and 103 payments totaling $661 thousand were stopped due to this initiative. This process is successful in identifying deceased annuitants and ensuring improper payments are not made. In addition, all annuity manual payments processed through Treasury’s Secure Payment System are reviewed through the DMF online search prior to making payment. 

For non-Treasury Disbursing Office oversees payments, payee information is checked against Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control’s (OFAC) list of Specially Designated Nationals (SDN). During 2023, there were 2,624,564 payments totaling $9.9 billion of potential payment matches reviewed resulting in no stopped payments.

In addition, Department grants processed through the Health and Human Service (HHS) Payment Management System (PMS) are included in a DNP review. HHS incorporated a review of the DNP portal into their payment process to identify individuals or entities with delinquent Federal non-tax debt, a recipient that is listed as deceased on the DMF, and recipients excluded from doing business with the government.

The Department has taken extensive measures to ensure that managers, accountable officers (including Component CFOs), programs, and states and localities are held accountable for reducing and recapturing improper payments. In addition, the Department’s CFO, Deputy CFO, and senior staff have
performance expectations related to payment integrity and financial stewardship incorporated into their annual performance plans.

As a strong internal control environment is the best way to prevent and detect improper payments, Component managers are responsible for completing internal control work on payment processing as part of the Department’s OMB Circular No. A-123 effort. They are further responsible for establishing and maintaining sufficient internal controls, including a control environment that prevents improper payments from being made, effectively managing improper payment risks, and promptly detecting and recovering any improper payment that may occur.","2023"

(Unit- Free-Text)","The IRS Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CTC) conducted a risk assessment in FY 23 and although the risk assessment yielded a non-susceptible rating the IRS deems this program as susceptible to improper payments due to the similarity of this program with other programs that have high improper payment error rates. Tax year (TY) 2021 CTC was designed and implemented as part of the COVID-19 assistance programs; thus, the credit is similarly temporary in nature and has no basis for future improper payment estimates.  To estimate improper payment rates for refundable tax credits, the IRS must perform comprehensive audits over a large sample of tax returns.  Given the statutory timelines, IRS needs a minimum of three years to calculate an estimated improper payment rate for a given program, which in this case will be long after the TY 2021 CTC has ended.","2023"

(Unit- Free-Text)","The IRS continues significant efforts to bring its payment program to an improper rate of less than 10 percent.  The IRS captures metrics related to pre-refund activities and works closely with internal and external partners to expand outreach efforts.  Many of these metrics are tied to the pre-refund examination program and are highly dependent on assumptions such as available staff. The Refund Integrity and Compliance Services (RICS) Director conducts quarterly operational reviews with Refundable Credits Examination Operations (RCEO) and Refundable Credits Program Management (RCPM) on the refundable credits program. The RICS and RCPM Directors and managers have performance plan commitments that address enhancements to the program such as increasing refundable credit awareness, encouraging eligible taxpayers to apply for those credits, and emphasizing tax return accuracy. As noted, taxpayers self-certify eligibility for refundable tax credits and that the return is accurate.

The IRS performance plans also balance the outreach and awareness component with its examination program. Again, the IRS looks to find ways to enhance the taxpayer experience and improve the efficiencies in its processes and enhance case selection.  These plans are tied to management’s ratings ranging from Not Met to Outstanding and utilizes the SMART approach to ensure tangible results.","2023"
"DOD","arp18","[arp18](Optional) Provide any additional information or context about the agency recoveries. (Unit- Free-Text)","The Military Pay Payment Recovery Audit and Activities (PRA) incorporates all salary, benefits and other compensation related entitlements for all Service Members serving on Active Duty, Reserve, and National Guard. Irrespective of actual assignment, the Service Members Branch handles Military Pay. For example, for a Service Member assigned to a Combatant Command or Defense Agency, the Parent Military Branch is responsible for the Service Members pay. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) make these payments. The Military Branch coupled with DFAS relies heavily on their internal control process for pre and post payment reviews, entitlement verifications, reconciling management notices, Pay Record Accessibility audit, self assessment program, and focus metrics program.

The Department’s Civilian Pay PRA incorporates all salary, benefits and other compensation related entitlements for Department Civilians. The Civilian Pay process is dependent upon the built in internal controls for accuracy and timely distribution. The Department has an internal control structure in place for
testing time and attendance that provides reasonable assurance that the hours worked, hours in pay status, and hours absent are properly recorded.

The DoD Travel Pay PRA program incorporates all of the payments made by DFAS, in support of the Military Branches, Combatant Commands, and Defense Agencies for Service Members and Civilian Employees for mission required temporary and permanent travel- and/or transportation-related expenses.
The Department, through DFAS, uses a variety of pre and post payment internal controls to identify, prevent, and recoup travel overpayments.

The Commercial Pay PRA program is subject to all of the payments sent to contractors and vendors who provided various services and or delivered the required goods as outlined in the agreement or contract. The primary objective of the Commercial Pay PRA program is to recoup all monetary loss associated with payment made to outside contractors and vendors. The Department's PRA Commercial Pay activities focus on reporting and correcting any type of monetary loss. As part of the Department’s overall system of internal controls, any overpayment that have been identified in sampled items for the PIIA compliance audit are reported to the DoD Component where the transaction originated. The process is similar to when overpayments are discovered through different PIIA audits, reviews, and reports. Regardless of the identification source of the overpayment, the Department actively pursues all available methods for recouping erroneous overpayments as part of the overarching PRA program. 

DFAS is the sole service provider for the processing and payroll of the Retired and Annuitant populations (R&A) for the Department. DFAS is at the forefront of ensuring the appropriate controls are in place to combat and assist in the mitigation of risk for potential erroneous or improper payments. Based upon the
guidance from the Department, DFAS R&A quickly worked to identify and ascertain their processes that are in place to detect, identify, and recoup any erroneous payments through its multiple payroll areas. DFAS is well postured to continue to identify the risks associated with payment recapture activities and
implement checks and balances as a need arises.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Finance Center disburses all of the travel and commercial payments for USACE. USACE discovers overpayments through the contract closeout process, through routine audits and supplemented by the PIIA audit process. The USACE Finance Center Debt Management Office performs the necessary actions to recoup the payment once the overpayment is identified and the bill is created.

The Military Health Benefits PRA portfolio is administered and managed by the Defense Health Agency. The TRICARE program provides healthcare services to 9.4 million beneficiaries. These refunds represent overpayments recovered as a result of payment errors identified through the compliance review process, refunds occurring in the course of routine healthcare claims processing, healthcare claim adjustments or corrections as identified by civilian providers, or TRICARE beneficiaries and claim corrections as the result of internal post-payment audits conducted by private sector.","2023"

(Unit - Free-Text)","The threats to our homeland have evolved over the 20 years of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). One constant is the legacy of service of our workforce. They’ve delivered results for America every day since 2003 and continue to contribute to a safer tomorrow for all Americans.

Over the past 20 years, the threat landscape has evolved. While we continue to face the threat of international terrorism, new threats and challenges have emerged, including increasing incidents of targeted violence, cyberattacks and several natural disasters, as well as the unprecedented level of migration in our hemisphere. The 260,000-strong DHS workforce uses its skills and expertise to meet the challenges of today’s world and prepare for the threats of tomorrow, responding with new programs and capabilities, cross-component collaboration, and unflinching dedication to the mission.

Today, DHS spans over two dozen agencies and offices that work collaboratively to protect the American public in the air by securing air travel; on land by securing the border, responding to natural disasters, protecting critical infrastructure, and administering our nation’s legal immigration system; at sea by protecting our coastline and waterways; and in cyberspace by bolstering America’s cyber defense and investigating cybercrime.

In 2017, the nation faced a historic Atlantic hurricane season. The effects from consecutive hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria were widespread, causing long-lasting damage across the southern continental U.S. and surrounding islands, as well as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Supplemental appropriations were designated as an emergency requirement in the Supplemental Appropriations for
Disaster Relief Requirements, 2017 (P.L. 115-56, the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act of 201 7 (P.L. 11572), and the Further Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-123) were issued to specific agencies to provide the resources needed to recover and rebuild following recent hurricanes and other applicable natural disasters. Within these supplemental appropriations, DHS received a total supplemental appropriation amount of $50.72 billion. Per the language of the supplemental appropriations, once disaster supplemental funded programs initially met or exceeded the $10 million disbursement threshold for payments applicable for Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) review for the 12-month reporting period, the program was deemed susceptible to significant improper payments and thus applicable for statistical sampling and reporting. Since the Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements disbursement activity began, the Department has identified and monitored programs that have expended more than $10 million in applicable outlays in any given fiscal year (FY).

In 2020, our Nation faced one of the biggest threats in recent history—the COVID-19 pandemic. In a swift response, Congress provided $2 trillion in supplemental funding through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, an economic relief package. As the executer of over $45 billion in CARES Act funding, DHS was at the epicenter in the Federal Government’s response to the pandemic and worked closely with other federal agencies, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments to distribute the much-needed funding. In FY 2020, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated the National Response Coordination Center (NRCC) in the wake of the Coronavirus outbreak in the United States. The NRCC is a multi-agency center that coordinates the overall federal support for major incidents and emergencies. NRCC also provides a clearinghouse of resources and policies for local and state governments in impacted regions.

In FY 2021, DHS Components received over $50 billion in funding from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) with the majority allotted to the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). The DRF is an appropriation used to direct, coordinate, manage, and fund eligible response and recovery efforts associated with domestic major disasters and emergencies. In addition, the FEMA DRF received over $19 billion from the Consolidated Appropriations Act (CAA) to carry out disaster relief activity, including COVID-19 related activity. 

FEMA provided front-line support for the U.S. response to the pandemic through mass vaccination sites and providing coordination across the FEMA regions. The COVID-19 Pandemic Operational Guidance issued during the 2020 Hurricane Season, outlines how FEMA has adapted its response and recovery operations in a COVID-19 environment. At the same time, this guidance has other implications moving forward, for example, providing a workforce mix for any future scenarios similar to the response during this pandemic. The Pandemic Operational Guidance also helps to shape a shared understanding among local and regional emergency managers and FEMA about roles and expectations in such deployments. The pandemic impacts current and future requirements for response and recovery logistics and products, such as determining eligible work and costs for non-congregate sheltering in response to a Presidentially declared emergency or major disaster, processing grants, how to manage communications, and training during such responses, and employing tools requiring limited on-site presence—such as satellite imagery—to assess damage.

Due to the burden of testing and reporting for the programs impacted heavily by disaster supplemental appropriation disbursements, DHS is generally reporting statistical testing results two years in arrears. Therefore, FY 2021 disbursement testing and results are reported in the 2023 reporting. 

While supporting the mission, DHS remains strongly committed to ensuring our agency’s transparency and accountability to the American taxpayer and achieving the most cost-effective strategy on the reduction of improper payments. For specifics regarding changes in reporting for specific programs as well as program results, please refer to the program level reporting. In comparison to prior year reporting, DHS has:

a) Removed 5 programs from PIIA Phase 2 reporting, effective for the 2023 reporting period as they dropped below the $10 million outlay threshold based on FY 2021 disbursement activity and/ or have adequately baselined the program under PIIA requirements and have been determined to not be susceptible to significant improper payments and thus reverted to PIIA Phase 1.

 • FEMA Public Assistance - Validate as You Go (VAYGo)

FEMA’s Public Assistance Program provides supplemental grants to state, tribal, territorial, and local governments, and certain types of private non-profits so communities can quickly respond to and recover from major disasters or emergencies. After an event like a hurricane, tornado, earthquake or wildfire, communities need help to cover their costs for debris removal, life-saving emergency protective measures, and restoring public infrastructure. FEMA provides this assistance based on authority in statutes, executive orders (EOs), regulations, and policies.

In 2019, FEMA implemented the Validate as You Go (VAYGo) Public Assistance grants payments review process for major disaster declarations resulting from the Harvey, Irma, and Maria disasters, to comply with statutory improper payment review and reporting requirements to significantly reduce project closeout documentation requirements for recipients with proven effective internal control processes. In December 2020, FEMA expanded VAYGo to all Public Assistance and Fire Management Assistance Grants major disasters and emergency declarations beginning with disasters declared in fiscal year 2020.

On March 13, 2020, the Presidential declaration of a nationwide COVID emergency increased the level of federal response from FEMA, as well as support to state, local, tribal, and territorial partners across the nation. The agency’s response to COVID was unprecedented. When the White House directed FEMA to lead operations, COVID became the first national pandemic response that FEMA has led since it was established in 1979. It was also the first time in U.S. history the President declared a nationwide emergency under Section 501b of the Stafford Act and authorized Major Disaster Declarations for all states and territories for the same incident. FEMA, through its 10 Regions, managed 57 concurrent Presidential Major Disaster Declarations for COVID and worked with 91 tribal nations. 

In April 2022, FEMA strategically paused the VAYGo program to conduct listening sessions and identify ways to improve the VAYGo testing process. As a result of those listening sessions, FEMA published the VAYGo Guide and distributed to Regions and Recipients. This guide provides implementation and delivery guidance for the FEMA VAYGo grant payment review process and includes details on documentation requirements to support recipient drawdowns and financial disbursements. The guidance is designed to enhance the customer experience for all stakeholders involved in VAYGo processes while also establishing a framework for implementing measures to reduce the administrative burden of grants management when improper payment rates meet or fall below the minimum threshold established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). On Aug. 9, 2023, FEMA reinstated VAYGo, which now includes the new implementation guide and a new closeout benefit for qualifying recipients.

To date, FEMA has obligated over $70.59 billion dollars for COVID-19 public assistance. This is spread to cover over 30 thousand requests for public assistance, over 22 thousand eligible applicants, and over 39 thousand active projects. As this specific disaster declaration was so wide reaching and impacted so many individuals, the span of the public assistance provided is extensive. In order to sufficiently assess the appropriateness of these payments, the request for information is broad and often takes a substantial amount of time to obtain the necessary documentation and of adequate quality and completeness to enable auditability. Therefore, due to the impact of the VAYGo strategic pause as well as the significant increase in assessment burden, DHS has delayed the PIIA Phase 2 reporting for the FEMA Public Assistance - VAYGo program until 2024. This delay in reporting will allow the Department to continue to work with Regions and Recipients to obtain the necessary supporting documentation and complete an adequate assessment to determine the appropriateness of the disbursement activity. DHS remains fully committed to providing transparent reporting and this delay will ensure that the reporting is a complete and accurate representation of the payment integrity for this program.","2023"

The frequency and complexity of fraud attacks, specifically identity (ID) fraud, against state unemployment programs increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. A combination of decades of underfunding, outdated state UI information technology (IT) systems, record claims volumes, and weaker integrity controls in 2020, provided an opportunity for criminals to exploit vulnerabilities in state UI systems, which resulted in elevated rates of improper payments. State UI systems were, and continue to be, targeted by sophisticated and organized fraud, perpetrated by domestic and international criminal organizations. While states worked tirelessly to rapidly combat relentless fraud attacks, the fraud schemes continue to evolve to circumvent prevention and detection tools and strategies implemented by states. ETA and state UI agencies continue to work collaboratively with the Department’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) and refer cases of UI fraud, waste, abuse, mismanagement, and misconduct to the Department’s OIG for investigation and prosecution.

The Department places a heightened priority on program integrity and mitigating UI fraud risks. ETA remains fully committed to reducing IPs and combatting fraud in the UI programs and continues to make UI program integrity a top agency priority. In FY 2023, the Department engaged in a fraud risk assessment project to ensure existing fraud risk management activities are assessed, conducted, and evaluated in alignment with the leading practices provided in the Government Accountability Office’s (GAO) Fraud Risk Framework, which led to the documentation and development of a UI Fraud Risk Profile.  ETA develops, updates, oversees, and communicates UI antifraud strategies through a robust and dynamic UI Integrity Strategic Plan, which continuously evolves and includes innovative strategies and antifraud controls to combat emerging fraud schemes and address the highest residual risk identified in the UI Fraud Risk Profile. ETA’s efforts to improve program integrity in the unemployment compensation (UC) programs include providing guidance, technical assistance, resources, and funding to support states in combatting fraud, strengthening ID verification, reducing IPs, recovering overpayments, assessing and addressing fraud risks, protecting victims of ID fraud, and evaluating data to ensure effectiveness and equity in fraud prevention and detection efforts. The Department continues to explore, research, identify, invest in, and provide states with new tools, resources, strategies, and guidance to help states combat the continually changing and new emerging types of sophisticated fraud impacting the UI system.

PIIA requires agencies to review and assess all programs and activities with  annual outlays greater than $10,000,000 for improper payment risk at least once every three years to identify those susceptible to significant improper payments.

In FY 2023, PBGC performed a risk assessment of two payment streams in accordance with our three-year rotation strategy. The two payment streams reviewed during FY 2023 were Multiemployer Special Financial Assistance Payments and Payments to Federal Employees. In performing the risk assessments, PBGC considered factors specified in statute and further defined in OMB guidance, including the complexity of the payment stream; the volume of payments; recent major changes in program funding, authorities, practices, or procedures; the level, experience, and quality of training for personnel responsible for making program eligibility determinations or certifying that payments are accurate; whether the program is new to the agency; whether payments or payment eligibility decisions are made outside of PBGC; significant deficiencies in the audit reports issued by the PBGC Office of Inspector General (OIG) and the Government Accountability Office (GAO); similarities to other programs that have reported improper
payments (IP) and unknown payments (UP) estimates; the accuracy and reliability of IP and UP estimates previously reported for the program; whether the program lacks information or data systems to confirm eligibility; and the risk of fraud as assessed by the agency under the Standards for Internal Control in the

The Agency is required by the PIIA to assess the disbursement process and estimate the approximate amount of improper payments every three years. The Agency’s latest IPIA assessment and review performed by an independent consultant in FY 2022 concluded that the NLRB program and activities were at a low risk for improper payments. 

For FY 2023, NLRB processed $285,701,520 in disbursements which included payroll and benefits of $233,880,801 and travel of $1,122,109.  In addition, the NLRB paid $50,698,610 to vendors which accounted for 18 percent of the total disbursements. 

The Agency’s independent review evaluated the procedures in the Agency’s payment and disbursement processes. It also tested and assessed the design and effectiveness of internal controls. Given these controls, the IPIA assessment found no improper payment in the testing and found that the estimated improper payments to be within the thresholds defined by IPIA. Thus, improper payments for the NLRB’s programs did not exceed $10 million and 1.5 percent of the program total expenditures or $100 million of the total program expenditures. The Agency estimates the improper payments rate to be at most 1.5 percent and the improper payment amount to be no more than $4,285,523. Therefore, the NLRB has effective procedures and controls in place for its payment and disbursement processes. The NLRB has reasonable assurance that controls over financial and non-financial operations are sufficient. No additional reporting requirements are necessary.

The EPA’s payments are screened by the Department of the Treasury’s DNP working system to detect improper payments. The Treasury analyzes each agency’s payments and provides a monthly report itemizing any payments that were made to potentially ineligible recipients. These potential matches are identified when the name of an agency’s payee matches the name of an individual or entity listed in federal data sources contained in the Treasury’s DNP working system. 

In FY 2023, the Treasury screened the EPA payments through the following DNP data sources on a post- payment basis: the Social Security Administration’s Death Master File and the General Services Administration’s System for Award Management Exclusion List. During FY 2023 a total of 226,737 EPA payments worth $3.76 billion of the EPA payments were screened, and no improper payments were identified.

As such, we have long held that focusing enforcement resources on the larger tax gap is a more efficient and cost-effective way to minimize the tax gap and maximize tax collections.  We continue to support the reporting of RTC errors as part of the tax gap estimate as a better reflection of how the IRS approaches taxpayer compliance relative to the U.S. tax system.

The statutory structure and design for administering refundable tax credit refunds prevents the IRS from verifying or validating such amounts prior to making a refund. Consequently, errors are not the result of internal control weaknesses that we can remediate internally but are, in fact, the result of factors beyond our control under current law and existing authority.  Even if we could obtain legislative changes and invest in additional resources and verification solutions that would ultimately reduce errors, the benefits derived would be marginal relative to the costs.

The reporting period for this data call reflects FY 2023, and whether the agency is compliant will be determined in calendar year 2024.  PIIA requires agencies to review and assess all programs with annual outlays greater than $10,000,000 for improper payment risk at least once every three years to identify those susceptible to significant improper payments.  Programs that are not likely to have an annual amount of improper payments plus annual unknown payments above the statutory threshold (which is either (a) both 1.5 percent of program outlays and $10,000,000 of all program payments made during the fiscal year, or (b) $100,000,000) are in Phase 1.  Per this definition, our Administrative Payments program is in Phase 1 for Office of Management and Budget reporting purposes.  Our assessment of improper payment risk in our Administrative Payments program in FY 2021 determined that the program is not susceptible to significant improper payments.  We will conduct another improper payment risk assessment of our Administrative Payments program in FY 2024.  If a program in Phase 1 is likely to annually make improper payments and unknown payments above the statutory threshold, then the program will move into Phase 2 the following year.  Once in Phase 2 a program will have additional requirements such as reporting an annual improper payment and unknown payment estimate.  Our Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs are in Phase 2.

Based on our FY 2022 stewardship reviews (FY 2023 stewardship information will be available in summer 2024), we estimate that we paid approximately $1.3 trillion to OASDI beneficiaries.  Of that total, we estimate about $6.5 billion were overpayments, representing approximately 0.51 percent of outlays.  We estimate that underpayments during this same period were $1.8 billion, the equivalent of approximately 0.14 percent of outlays.  OASDI overpayments within the agency’s control are due to our failure to access data or information needed.  These overpayments occur when the beneficiary or third-party provided data or information that we requested and was necessary to accurately compute the benefit amount, but we failed to use the data or information needed to validate the payment accuracy prior to making a payment.  To prevent these overpayments from occurring, technicians follow existing procedures and we provide training and reminders for technicians when applicable and automation solutions to improve accuracy when possible.

OASDI and SSI overpayments outside of the agency’s control occur when we are unable to access data needed to validate payment accuracy because the beneficiary or a third-party either did not provide requested information or provided inaccurate information necessary to compute the accurate benefit amount.  The primary cause of these overpayments is our reliance on timely self-reporting of employment and wage information.  Therefore, we are developing a new wage reporting tool.  We conducted planning and analysis to develop automated employer participation notices and a limited issue reminder to address incoming wage and employment information that does not automatically post to the records.  We implemented these improvements in FY 2023.  Overall, we continue to have a high payment accuracy rate.

Our greatest payment accuracy challenges occur within the SSI program.  SSI is a means-tested program for individuals with limited income and resources who are blind, disabled, or aged.  Administering the SSI program is complicated by the statutory requirement for us to determine SSI eligibility and calculate SSI payments monthly.  We generally make SSI payments on the first day of the month for eligibility in that month.  Many factors impact SSI payment accuracy.  Even if a payment was correct when paid, subsequent changes in that month can affect the payment due, resulting in either an overpayment or underpayment.  Thus, the program requirements sometimes make improper payments inevitable.  Improper payments often occur if recipients (or their representative payees) fail to timely report changes in any of their eligibility factors (e.g., an increase of their resources or a change in their wages).  Failure to report changes is the primary cause of both overpayments and underpayments.

Based on our FY 2022 stewardship reviews (FY 2023 stewardship information will be available in summer 2024), we estimate that we paid approximately $57.6 billion to SSI recipients.  Of that total, we estimate about $4.6 billion were overpayments, representing approximately 8.02 percent of outlays.  We estimate that underpayments during this same period were $680.8 million, the equivalent of approximately 1.18 percent of outlays.

Of the estimated $4.6 billion in SSI overpayments, approximately $4.3 billion was due to factors outside of the agency’s control because the data or information to validate payment accuracy prior to making payment does not exist or is inaccessible to us.  The primary cause of these overpayments is reliance on timely self-reporting of employment and wage information.  We are addressing this root cause by conducting quality reviews and cost-effective program integrity work including SSI non-medical redeterminations.  To reduce the reliance on self-reporting, we continue to expand and pursue new data exchange partners from government and private sectors.

Approximately $287 million in SSI overpayments were within the agency’s control and due to our failure to access data or information to validate payment accuracy prior to making a payment.  The primary causes of these overpayments are incorrectly computing the payment or failure to obtain or act on available information affecting the payment.  We are addressing this root cause by investing in information technology modernization to provide our employees with user-friendly systems and tools.  To meet the challenges of our growing workloads and provide the best service possible, we are streamlining our policies and procedures, issuing reminders to technicians, and automating more of our business processes.

We implemented the Improper Payments Alignment Strategies (IPAS) to focus on our corrective actions to address the root causes of improper payments in both the OASDI and SSI programs.  As part of our IPAS, we evaluate the effectiveness of each completed mitigation initiative.  Additionally, we determine the most cost-effective strategies to remediate the underlying causes of payment errors and monitor, measure, and revise the strategies as needed.","2023"

"DOT","exs1","[exs1] Provide an executive summary of the payment integrity activities and results for the agency for this reporting period (SEE - 'Helpful Hint' - minimum length requirements vary depending on Agency status). (Unit - Free-Text)","The U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) recognizes the importance of maintaining effective internal controls to ensure proper payments as evidenced by the 30% reduction of estimated improper payments (IP) compared to last fiscal year, $756 million of estimated IPs in Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 compared to $530 million in FY 2023. Common characteristics of DOT’s programs susceptible to significant IPs are that both programs are administered by grant recipients, typically a State DOT or local transit authority, and that IPs are outside of our control when the grant recipients make administrative errors. Whereas grant recipients are responsible for the administration of federal assistance, DOT is responsible, primarily through its division and regional offices, for ensuring compliance with Federal requirements and proper use of Federal funds. The IP sampling and estimation process is an example of one method DOT utilizes to assess grant recipient compliance with Federal requirements and to identify emerging causes of payment integrity risk.

DOT prioritizes efforts to identify and reduce improper payments through robust internal control programs by establishing aggressive goals. Our reduction target aligns with the Organizational Excellence strategic objective within the Department's FY 2022-2026 Strategic Plan to ensure responsible and transparent stewardship public resources. The plan includes a performance goal to achieve a 99% payment accuracy rate to demonstrate robust internal controls at both the Federal and grant recipient levels. For FY 2023, the Federal Highway Administration’s Highway Planning and Construction Plan program achieved a payment accuracy rate of 99.95% and the Federal Transit Administration’s Transit Infrastructure Grant – COVID Relief Funds reported a rate of 98.43%. 

Training and maintaining strong partnerships with our grant recipients are essential to reducing DOT’s IPs over time. While robust, the internal control systems and structures of our grant recipients across the Nation must constantly evolve to meet changing Federal statutory and regulatory requirements. For example, the statutory COVID relief funding requirements established a date, January 20, 2020, for cost eligibility. While well defined, the date is quite arbitrary when applied to a grant recipient payroll system that processes retroactive pay adjustments or reimbursement processes that bundle newly eligible costs from a wide range of dates. Hence, continued collaboration and communication between DOT and our State and Local partners is a necessity to ensure compliance with Federal requirements including the accuracy of payment requests. 

In addition to estimating IPs, the Department performed over 30 IP risk assessments of its programs, conducted a payment recovery audit, analyzed confirmed fraud cases, and screened payments against the Do Not Pay databases. DOT’s Payment Integrity Center is responsible for coordinating IP reviews, reporting results, and monitoring the progress of corrective actions in accordance with Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 and Office of Management and Budget Circular A-123 Appendix C, Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement. Federal personnel within DOT’s Payment Integrity Center performed the recovery audit. We take pride in reducing our estimated IPs in FY 2023 and remain committed to strengthening our payment processing controls going forward.","2023"

(Unit - Free-Text)","Treasury programs in phase 1 are required to complete a PIIA risk assessment once every three years. In FY 23, 29 programs completed a risk assessment. The years in between risk assessments, we require programs to complete a certification which states there has been no major changes to program funding or legislation that could impact the risk of improper payments.

Treasury reports error rates as outlined in the PIIA and OMB Appendix C, for four refundable tax credits (RTCs)—the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC), Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), and net Premium Tax Credit (PTC). Treasury was found non-compliant with PIIA in FY 22 due to not meeting the compliance criteria of reporting an improper payment rate of less than 10%.

The root cause of the errors in the EITC, AOTC, ACTC, and net PTC RTCs is not the result of internal control deficiencies and, as such, the IRS has continuously deployed costly enforcement tools to lower the error rate. These tools include training, such as the nationwide tax forum, due diligence training module and webinars, cross enterprise sharing with other Federal agencies, and change processes such as hosting annual Dependent Database (DDb) meetings with stakeholders to adjust the value of prior-year compliance filters for audit selection of returns claiming the RTCs and identifying improvement opportunities for the filing season. Deployment of enforcement tools has had minimal impact on lowering the error rate. The IRS continues significant efforts to bring its payment program to an improper rate of less than 10 percent. Without significant legislative action and restructuring of the refundable tax credit (RTC) programs, meeting a target date to be in compliance with PIIA will be a significant challenge.

The error rates for the four RTC programs that are susceptible to improper payments are not statistically different from the FY 22 error rates. Although the EITC and ACTC error rates increased, the margin of error is larger than in prior years. We would expect more variability in the estimates with the larger margins of error. The wider sample precision margins are the result of a reduction in the number of returns sampled that was necessitated by the significant reduction in the IRS’s budget over the last decade along with the resulting decrease in the IRS’s examination staff.  Additionally, regarding the ACTC, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) included a one-time, one-year amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, expanding the existing Child Tax Credit (CTC) laws for tax year 2021, which provided Child Tax Credit Improvements for Tax Year (TY) 2021 (TY 2021 CTC). ACTC’s improper payment rate is exclusive of TY 2021 CTC.  TY 2021 CTC is structured and processed differently than any previous non-refundable CTC, as eligible taxpayers automatically received advance payments (unless they opted-out) and later had to reconcile the credit on their 2021 tax returns.

At VA, these audits are performed in five major areas: Veterans Health Administration through a recovery audit, Veterans Benefits Administration for benefit programs where the Financial Services Center in Austin, Texas does not process their payments, the Financial Services Center which provides recovery audits for all payments it processes which includes Veterans Health Administration payments, some Veterans Benefits Administration payments, National Cemetery Administration payments, and VA's Staff Offices (for example, Office of Information Technology, Office of Management, and the Office of Human Resources & Administration/Operations, Security & Preparedness), as well as specific recovery audits performed for the Supply Fund payments in the Office of the Revolving Fund.  These are discussed in more detail below.

Veterans Health Administration
VHA utilizes a recovery audit contract, which will audit claims for the VACC program. The review includes pre-authorized claims paid under 38 U.S.C. § 1703 (authorized care) and will test to ensure the care rendered is in compliance with the authorization/referral; was reimbursed based on the appropriate methodology; and that the medical records support the diagnostic related group billed for the services. The amount of recovery audits being reported are only from FY 2018 per the condition of the contract. 
                                                                                               
Veterans Benefits Administration
Veterans Benefits Administration uses a combination of quality reviews and payment reviews to identify possible duplicates and overpayments. The majority of Veterans Benefits Administration programs perform quality reviews on randomly selected cases that ensure eligibility determinations, proper case processing, and payment accuracy. For all other programs, Veterans Benefits Administration performs payment reviews to identify potential duplicate payments and other potential overpayments. Veterans Benefits Administration tracks, monitors, and recovers overpayments eligible for recovery through combined efforts of the Debt Management Center, the Administrative and Loan Accounting Center, and Regional Offices.

Financial Services Center
The Financial Services Center, a franchise fund (fee-for-service) organization, provides required recovery audit services to Veterans Health Administration, National Cemetery Administration, Veterans Benefits Administration, and VA Staff Offices.  The Financial Services Center’s recovery audit program is focused on detection and recovery of overpayments for each program the Financial Services Center services that expends $1 million or more annually. The Financial Services Center reviews current and past payments in database portals to identify and recover improper payments such as duplicate payments, payments made in the incorrect amount, unapplied credits, etc. The Financial Services Center works with its customers to process bills of collection for identified improper payments. If the full amount of an improper payment was paid via electronic funds transfer (EFT), FSC processes a letter of reversal/letter of indemnity to recover the funds by having the bank reverse the erroneous transaction. In cases where the improper payment is paid via treasury check or where the improper amount was less/more than the full amount of the EFT, FSC or VA medical facilities process a bill of collection requesting the vendor return the funds for the improper amount. After a minimum of 45 days, if the vendor has not returned the funds, requested additional information, or disputed the bill of collection, an internal offset is processed to collect the funds from the next FSC-issued payment(s) to that same vendor until the debt is satisfied. If previous attempts to collect are unsuccessful, FSC refers the debt to the customer-preferred debt service program to collect the funds from the next government issued payment(s) to the vendor or employee until the bill is satisfied. Debt service programs can include the Treasury Offset Program or Debt Management Center cross servicing. Temporary changes to this process can occur at the program’s request until a permanent alternative is identified by the customer.

Office of Revolving Funds
The Office of Revolving Fund collaborates with the Office of Inspector General to perform recovery audits on VA's Supply Fund program. The Office of Inspector General identifies an overpayment and a bill of collection is then prepared by the Office of Revolving Funds with appropriate terms of collection. If the vendor chooses to dispute the bill of collection Veterans Affairs will work towards appropriate resolution.","2023"

(Unit - Free-Text)","VA has invested in payment integrity efforts, where appropriate, to prevent improper payments from occurring.  This is evidenced by VA reporting five consecutive years of reductions in improper and unknown payments – a reduction of $11.6 billion or 79%.  These efforts have also allowed VA to remove a total of seven programs from reporting improper and unknown payments during this same timeframe.  Below are some highlighted activities occurring across the Department to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent as intended and VA fulfills this nations promise to its Veterans.

Veterans Health Administration
Veterans Health Administration attributes the significant reduction in and prevention of improper and unknown payments over the last five years to agency-specific efforts such as the development of 50 plus business rules and artificial intelligence built into the claims processing system that allows claims that meet all rules to auto-adjudicate without human intervention. Improper payments are identified on a continual (real-time) basis in multiple systems at multiple levels throughout the life-cycle of a claim from when the medical provider/third party administrator submits the claim, to the claim processing through the VA source system and into VA's Program Integrity Tool, and then back to the VA source system for payment and adjudication. Pre-payment control logic includes, but is not limited to, duplicate checks, aberrant billing patterns, coding and billing errors, and the List of Excluded Individuals and Entities.

Veterans Benefits Administration
As part of Veterans Benefits Administration Do Not Pay - Activities, multiple internal and external activities outside of the Treasury Working System are in place that focus on the prevention of overpayments. Veterans Benefits Administration receives continuous information from several Federal agencies, which it uses to verify the status of Veterans Affairs beneficiaries. This information identifies instances where there may be inconsistencies between VA records and data furnished by other Federal agencies that may affect entitlement to Compensation and Pension benefits. The following describes the various agreements:

Fugitive Felon Match - The Office of Inspector General entered into a computer matching agreement with law enforcement agencies for a list of individuals with felony arrest warrants to match against VA records, identifying beneficiaries that might be fugitive felons. 

Social Security Verification Match - Quarterly, the Social Security Administration provides information on Social Security Administration rates for recipients of VA Pension and Parents' Dependency and Indemnity Compensation to verify reported income.

Social Security Administration Prison Match - The Social Security Administration provides VA with information on prisoners. Periodically, data from Compensation and Pension records are run against Social Security's inmate database to identify VA beneficiaries who may be subject to reduction or termination of benefits. 

The Bureau of Prisons Match - Provides Veterans Benefits Administration with information on Federal prisoners. On a monthly basis, Compensation and Pension files are matched with Bureau of Prisons' inmate database to identify incarcerated beneficiaries, which may require a reduction of termination of benefits. 

The Social Security Death Master File - The Social Security Administration provides VA a list of deceased individuals. On a weekly basis, Compensation and Pension records are matched with the Death Master File to identify possible deceased beneficiaries to determine if benefits need to be terminated. 

Financial Services Center
The Financial Services Center leverages data available within the Treasury Working System via Computer Matching Agreements with Treasury to continually update the vendor file used to store payee information for individuals and vendors doing business with VA.  Potential matches are identified in the file and will be used if invoices/claims are submitted from matched individuals and vendors in the future. The Financial Services Center is continuing the partnership with Treasury to utilize additional data that will improve customer service, to include reducing the time it takes to validate new vendors or changes to existing vendor information. This partnership and use of data made available to Treasury by various federal agencies will improve VA’s ability to stop future potential improper payments in a pre-payment state. 

Additionally, FSC reviews prepayments scheduled for future payment for all customer field stations against any other scheduled payments and payment history daily. FSC utilizes the Invoice Payment Processing System (IPPS) and Business Activity Monitoring system as part of the invoice review process, and the data sources contain business rules designed to assist with the identification and prevention of improper payments. Payments determined to be duplicates are denied before the payment is disbursed.","2023"
"VA","exs1","[exs1] Provide an executive summary of the payment integrity activities and results for the agency for this reporting period (SEE - 'Helpful Hint' - minimum length requirements vary depending on Agency status). (Unit - Free-Text)","VA has made great progress in the reduction of improper and unknown payments as it continues to implement Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) requirements. Since FY 2018, VA has reduced improper and unknown payments by $11.6 billion, or 79% and removed a total of 7 programs from reporting requirements, utilizing mitigation strategies and corrective actions that prioritized the largest proportion of errors and noncompliance with laws and regulations. 

PIIA requires agencies to review and assess all programs and activities with annual outlays greater than $10 million for improper payment risk at least once every three years to identify those susceptible to significant improper payments. In addition, VA conducts off-cycle improper payment risk assessments when a significant change in legislation and/or a significant change in funding occurs as required by Office of Management and Budget.  For FY 2023, VA is reporting 66 programs in Phase 1 (subject to risk assessment requirements) with 30 programs completing an improper and unknown payment risk assessment. Each of the 30 programs, or 100%, were determined below significant risk of improper and unknown payment thresholds, defined as $10 million and 1.5% of outlays or $100 million in total. 

Likewise, for those programs determined to be at risk of significant improper and unknown payments, PIIA requires Agencies to follow OMB implementation guidance for testing, reporting, and remediating improper and unknown payments. For FY 2023, VA is reporting a total of $3.2 billion in projected improper and unknown payments across 7 programs in Phase 2: Beneficiary Travel; Communications, Utilities, and Other Rent; Medical Care Contracts and Agreements; Pension; Purchased Long Term Services and Supports; Supplies and Materials; and VA Community Care. Specifically, VA reports $1.8 billion in monetary loss, $1.2 billion in nonmonetary loss improper payments ($9 million in underpayments, $1.2 billion in technically improper), and $191.3 million in unknown payments. VA’s reported improper and unknown payments is a reduction of $334 million or 10% from FY 2022 results and is VA’s fifth consecutive year of reported reductions. It is important to note that VA efforts to reduce improper and unknown payments outpaced overall outlay increases of $4.3 billion in FY 2023, or 14%, due to effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies. 

For FY 2023, all 7 VA programs achieved a reduction in their improper and unknown payment rates with 4 programs also reducing their improper and unknown payment amounts. The remaining 3 programs were unable to overcome outlay increases, resulting in an increase in their improper and unknown payment amounts despite improvements evidenced by a reduction in rate. Reductions to overall improper and unknown payments is attributed to VA’s robust process to update corrective action plans annually based on testing results, and no less than quarterly throughout the fiscal year, to ensure actions are appropriately prioritized and designed to mitigate risks of improper and unknown payments. Effectiveness reviews are also conducted annually to measure if actions reduced or were properly designed to reduce improper and unknown payments using set benchmarks for specific root causes. 

In FY 2023, VA’s highest contributor of monetary losses were within VA’s control and occurred when programs failed to validate invoice amounts were in accordance with contract rates or services were eligible per regulatory or contractual requirements. These errors accounted for $902.9 million, or 29% of VA’s total improper and unknown payments. During FY 2023, VA implemented an action to update internal policies ensuring the correct rates were paid. In FY 2024, VA will prioritize addressing errors resulting in monetary loss. VA will continue to implement actions that include clarifying payment methodology within VA, ensuring third party administrators bill at the correct allowable rates and invoices are validated per contract pricing, and identifying if system updates are needed to ensure claims are paid appropriately. 

Additional major causes of VA improper and unknown payments in FY 2023 stemmed from technically improper payments which accounted for $1.2 billion, or 37%, of VA’s total improper and unknown payments. Of the $1.2 billion, approximately $958.4 million, or 81%, did not meet procurement or statutory requirements because orders were placed by unauthorized individuals or VA was unable to obtain written documentation to support the ordering officer delegation. To remediate these technically improper payments, VA continues to implement process and policy updates to mitigate unauthorized commitments and utilize allowable contracts and agreements to improve compliance.  

In FY 2023, VA’s Inspector General concluded that the agency was non-compliant with PIIA. VA was noncompliant because the improper and unknown payment rate in two programs, Pension and Purchased Long Term Services and Supports, was greater than 10%. The Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program will work to determine if system updates are needed to ensure claims are paid appropriately and invoices are being validated per contract pricing prior to payment, implement short- and long-term contracting options to improve compliance with procurement requirements, and enforce contract requirements for third party administrators to bill at the correct allowable rates. The Pension program continues to implement an automated match with Social Security Administration to identify differences in income amounts between social security benefits reported by beneficiaries and social security benefits per Social Security Administration records. The agency anticipates that the improper and unknown payment rate for both programs will be below 10% in FY 2026 due to the implementation of effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies.","2023"

All programs utilize the Portal during the pre-award step, most utilize pre-award and pre-payment, while a few programs utilize pre-award, pre-payment, and post-payment. 

The end of the various COVID-19 related assistance programs, which broadened USDA programs in a variety of ways, including the amount of funding available and eligibility requirements, resulted in USDA DNP search activities returning to pre-pandemic levels. During FY 2023, the number of DNP search activities decreased by nearly 95% (118,064 to 5,068) however the total dollar amount matched from those search activities only decreased by approximately 16% ($13.95M to $11.68M). 

USDA has increased its active users by approximately 5% from 1,780 in FY 2022 to 1,869 in FY 2023. These users span five USDA agencies and multiple program areas. USDA consistently increases the number of active users by at least 3% each fiscal year. 

USDA is currently in various stages of the enrollment and onboarding process with four new program areas. With the addition of these four programs, USDA is anticipating increasing user enrollment by 100% to 3400 users. The Department aims to have enrollment for these programs completed during FY 2024.

(Unit- Free-Text)","VA fulfills the requirements of the Do Not Pay (DNP) Initiative and reviews payments against Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) required databases. VA utilizes the Treasury Working Systems (TWS) payment integration, continuous monitoring, and batch matching functionalities. VA also utlizes the two reports available for download in the TWS for required reporting. The Payment Activity Report (PAR) provides VA a summary of the PAM payments, matches, and adjudication statuses. The Adjudication Summary report provides VA the summary adjudication status results each month. 

VA adjudicates matches within the TWS on a monthly basis. VA sends Treasury a file containing all of VA's payments. Specifically, VA submits the Payment Automation Manager (PAM) file to Treasury for matching against the TWS data sources. VA payments are matched against the TWS databases at the time of disbursement and the TWS match results are available in the TWS the next business day for adjudication. VA downloads TWS match results and review/adjudication of TWS matches are performed in accordance with VA processes and procedures. Therefore, VA is only able to use the TWS to confirm improper payments after the payment has already been made and potentially prevent future improper payments once due process is provided.  

Additionally, the Veterans Benefit Administration is currently piloting the Death Record Confidence (DRC) Scoring Tool, a new tool developed by DNP to help analytic customers prioritize their research efforts, improve their adjudication processes, and make informed decisions about payment eligibility. This tool is intended to enable DNP to more effectively identify deceased individuals within a dataset and help customers understand which payments are at risk of being issued to a deceased payee. The DRC Scoring tool includes access to the Electronic Verification of Vital Events Facts of Death. The new data source contains information about death certificates contained within the vital records of 44 participating states and jurisdictions. VA will utilize any TWS reports created by Treasury for using this functionality in future required reporting.

The Veterans Benefit Administration Insurance program utilizes the continuous monitoring file and has the ability to submit a file and receive matches before payments are made. Currently, there are no reports within TWS that track identification and/or prevention of improper payments that would enable VA to report on use of this function.","2023"

As a result, individual program responses may not be reflective of the overall agency response. For example, while VA responded yes to recovery activities, only 33 of 84 programs performed recovery activities. Additionally, some recoveries identified by Office of Management and Budget implementation guidance as activities versus recovery audits are minimal throughout a fiscal year, making it cost prohibitive break these out and track separately. Therefore, these are included in recovery audit reporting and recovery disposition aligns with recovery audit disposition requirements. Examples include recoveries resulting solely from Government initiated investigations/lawsuits that were not “self-reported” via Qui Tam.

 In FY 2023 some programs may have identified recoveries from a recovery audit prior to determining it was not cost-effective to perform recovery audits. Therefore, these programs are reported as determining it is not cost effective to perform recovery audits even though there are recoveries for these programs in VA's reporting on recoveries from recovery audits. In addition, some of those programs have amounts of overpayments identified through recovery audits in prior reporting periods that remain outstanding during this reporting period and are reported in VA's reporting on recoveries from recovery audits. 

VA’s recovery reporting in FY23 includes all recoveries for VA-Wide Payroll reported as recovery audits since the Defense Finance and Accounting Service could not delineate between recovery activities and recovery audits. Additionally, it is missing one week of reporting payroll data (9/24/23-9/30/23).

Agency wide totals for the disposition of funds are able to be reconciled to the recovery audit amount for the reporting period; however, recovery audit overpayments identified in the current reporting period that remain outstanding for zero to six months or six months to one year may not reconcile to the difference in the amount identified and amount recovered for the current reporting period.

(Unit - Free-Text)","Various conditions give rise to overpayments identified in recovery audits in different healthcare programs:

Medicare FFS: Overpayments are often detected in Medicare Fee-For-Service when data analysis and medical record reviews reveal inaccuracies in billed and paid claims. These claims are selected for audit based on prior-year improper payment rate data, indicating discrepancies in billing and payment accuracy.

Medicare Part D: Overpayments in Part D audits stem from a lack of documentation by plan sponsors when making payment determinations. To address this issue, CMS has taken steps to provide training to plan sponsors and share lessons learned from audits to promote best practices among plan sponsors.

Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP): Overpayments occur when Medicare's information about a beneficiary's additional insurance coverage is missing, incomplete, or inaccurate, leading Medicare to mistakenly or conditionally pay for services as the primary payer. The Medicare Secondary Payer Recovery Audit Contractor, operating as the Commercial Repayment Center, identifies and recovers these payments from the entity with primary payment responsibility. The MSP program aims to ensure that Medicare is aware of situations where it should not be the primary payer, and it follows Coordination of Benefits rules to determine the order of payment between Medicare and other insurers.

In each of these scenarios, the conditions giving rise to overpayments are being addressed through audits, training, documentation improvements, and enhanced coordination efforts to prevent and rectify improper payments and discrepancies in the healthcare payment system. These measures contribute to the overall integrity of healthcare programs and the responsible use of public funds.","2023"

SAM:  We comply with regulations to use the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), which accomplishes the same purpose as the Exclusions query via SAM.gov.  From SAM.gov, we can verify through Entity Registrations if any person or organization is registered to do business with the Federal Government and determine a person or organization’s eligibility to do business with the Federal Government through a check of the Exclusions query.  We are precluded from soliciting offers from, awarding contracts to renew, placing or renewing orders with, or otherwise extending the duration of a current contract with any entity who has been determined ineligible from doing business with the Federal Government unless the head of the agency (or designee) determines there is a compelling reason to do so.

As prescribed in our policy, the State disability determination services (DDS) offices are required to check the LEIE at least annually.  LEIE includes the names of providers excluded from Federally funded health care programs.  The DDS offices also verify medical licenses, credentials, and certifications with State medical boards.

DMF:  The DMF is a publicly available extract of death information created from our internal records (i.e., the Numident).  These records contain information, such as name, Social Security number (SSN), date of birth, and date of death of deceased SSN holders.  We update death information on the Numident daily based on information from acceptable reporters (e.g., States, funeral homes, and family members).  We distribute reported death information to our related records using a complex systems interface.  Because our internal death data are more complete than the extracts, we do not use DNP for purposes of verifying death.

State Death Data:  We receive state death data directly from the states through the Electronic Death Registration process.  Under Section 205(r) of the Social Security Act, we may only provide State death data, on a reimbursable basis, to Federal or State agencies for specific purposes.  Per Section 801 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, we will be providing Treasury’s DNP with State death data beginning December 27, 2023 for a three-year period.

Prisoner Information:  To comply with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, we collaborated with Treasury’s Bureau of Fiscal Service to provide current prisoner information.  Because our PUPS is more complete than the data available via DNP, we use our internal data to verify incarceration.","2023"

The RRB notified OMB of our approach in August 2011. The agency is diligent in its recovery efforts for overpayments. The agency conducts numerous quality assurance reviews focused on detecting improper payments in the vendor and employee payment programs. The reviews constitute a robust monitoring program for improper payments and consistently return a zero percent error rate. The most recent Fiscal Years’ (2021 and 2022) results concluded that there was no indication of improper payments. In addition, we perform a bi-weekly review of payroll which includes a HR Links report of hours certified by supervisors and a General Services Administration's report which identifies the payroll amount for the same period. A comparison of the two reports is completed to verify that the two totals reconcile. Based on the comparisons, results have not returned any indication of improper payments related to payroll. Thus, no recapture audit program or alternative method for vendor and employee payments would be deemed cost effective as current management controls are proving effective. Taken as a whole, our full range of current activities constitutes an effective alternative to a formal payment recapture program.

We have no plans to conduct payment recapture audits or contract for a private sector payment recapture auditing firm because of the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs’ complexity.  We conducted extensive market research prior to deciding not to use external auditors.  We put out a Request for Information and received approximately 15 responses.  We interviewed all of the respondents, who agreed that they could not match our benefit payments internal controls and audit mechanisms because of the complexity of our programs.  The typical claims specialist (our principal benefits reviewer, authorizer and adjudicator position) receives an average of 13 weeks of training prior to entering the job and does not achieve journeyman status until they have been on the job for 2 years.

We have a comprehensive debt collection program.  We collected $4.9 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2023 at an administrative cost of $0.08 on average per dollar collected.  To recover overpayments, we use internal debt collection techniques (i.e., payment withholding, billing, and follow up), as well as some external collection techniques authorized by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 for OASDI debts and the Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 for SSI debts.

We developed a system to use the Treasury Offset Program (TOP), credit bureau reporting, and Administrative Wage Garnishment collection mechanisms for delinquent debts.  Because the system includes more than TOP and is the basis for any future collection interfaces with outside agencies or entities, we call it the External Collection Operation system.

As resources permit, we are making improvement in other aspects of our debt collection program.  In FY 2018, we began modernization efforts to build a new Debt Management System.  This information technology investment is a multiyear effort intended to build a comprehensive overpayment system enabling us to record, track, collect, and report our overpayments more efficiently.

The Federal Government uses the reclamation process to recover benefit payments paid via direct deposit to the financial account of a beneficiary who died and is not entitled to the payment, became legally incapacitated, or who died before the date of the payment(s).  To recover OASDI and SSI payments from U.S. financial institutions, we must send reclamation requests within 120 days of the date we learn of a beneficiary’s death.  A financial institution may protest a recovery of funds if we did not initiate the reclamation timely.

For Administrative Payments, our current recovery activities program is a proven cost-effective means for evaluating payment accuracy and identifying improper payments.  In 2013, we contracted with a private sector recovery auditing firm on a contingency fee basis to review our administrative payments.  The firm based its review on past industry experience of improper payment rates, and a cost/benefit analysis of transactions processed by type and dollars paid.

(Unit- Free-Text)","With oversight from the Employment and Training Administration (ETA), each state Unemployment Insurance (UI) agency is responsible for promoting and maintaining UI program integrity through prevention, detection, investigation, establishment, and recovery of improper payments. States identify and establish overpayments for recovery using methods such as crossmatching with the State Directory of New Hires, the National Directory of New Hires, the UI Integrity Center’s Integrity Data Hub, quarterly wage records submitted by employers, matches with databases such as Workers Compensation, incarceration records, and other sources such as tips and leads.

State UI laws provide for overpayment recovery and states are required to follow their individual state laws and policies in executing recovery efforts. ETA requires states to report quarterly on overpayment detection and recovery activities, including information on actual amounts of UI overpayments established and recovered.

States are required to hold claimants liable to repay improperly received benefits and take an active role to recover improper payments. Overpayment recovery is critical to protect both state UI trust funds and federal funds and ETA has reminded states that overpayment recovery must be given the same priority as fraud prevention and detection activities.  States may waive recovery of non-fraud overpayments when it would be against equity and good conscience pursuant to their state’s law. States may also waive recovery of certain non-fraud overpayments under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, as amended, in accordance with federal guidance (see Unemployment Insurance Program Letter (UIPL) No. 20-21 and 20-21, Change 1). Under no circumstances may a state waive recovery activities for a fraudulent overpayment.

ETA issued UIPL No. 23-20 reminding states of required and recommended program integrity functions, which includes overpayment recovery activities, for the unemployment compensation (UC) programs and consolidated, clarified, and expanded these activities with the issuance of UIPL No. 11-23.   ETA requires states to use the overpayment recovery tools listed below (with citations providing ETA with authority to require such actions):
•	Benefit Offsets (Title II, Subtitle A of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, UIPL No. 05-13, and Section 5 of UIPL No. 13- 20, Change 2);
•	Treasury Offset Program (TOP) for applicable covered debt (Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, UIPL No. 02-19, 12-14, and 04-20);
•	Cross Program Offset Recovery Agreement (CPORA) (UIPL No. 05-13); and
•	Interstate Reciprocal Offset Recovery Arrangement (IPORA) (UIPL No. 05-13).

ETA also strongly recommends states use the following additional overpayment recovery activities, where allowed by state law, as part of an effective overpayment recovery operation:
•	Negotiating repayment plans;
•	Accepting repayments through various methods (e.g. online, via debit/credit card);
•	State Income Tax Offset Program;
•	Wage garnishments;
•	Property liens and assessments;
•	Offsets of lottery winnings, homestead exemptions, and other benefits;
•	Active participation in probate and/or bankruptcy proceedings regarding an individual with an outstanding overpayment;
•	Skip tracing;
•	Work proactively and collaboratively with banks and financial institutions to detect suspicious activity, ensure that accounts are not unduly suspended, and recover overpayments (UIPL No. 19-21);
•	Civil actions;
•	Credit bureau referrals;
•	State/federal prosecution;
•	Penalties and interest on overpayments in compliance with state and federal law; 
•	Collection agency referrals when state staff is limited, or debt is uncollectable by other means; 
•	Implementing a voluntary fraud self-disclosure program; and

The Department researches all payments that are identified to be potentially improper. Research has determined that the majority of these match results are false positives (e.g., a vendor’s tax identification number is matched to a deceased individual’s social security number, and the payment is erroneously flagged). The remaining matches are almost always deemed proper based on established business rules related to contracts terms and vendor performance (as payments cannot be stopped to vendors who performed properly under contractual agreements).

PRA’s are reviews and analyses of program accounting and financial records, supporting documentation, and other pertinent information supporting its payments; and, it is, designed specifically, to identify overpayments. It is through this system of internal controls surrounding the payments that assists in resolving the erroneous non-intentional monetary loss of Department dollars. The Department also utilizes collaborative working groups and enhanced specific reports that are disseminated to the responsible Component for the identification, validation and potential corrective actions for the trends of overpayment types if necessary.","2022"
"DOD","arp18","[arp18](Optional) Provide any additional information or context about the agency recoveries. (Unit- Free-Text)","The Military Pay PRA incorporates all salary, benefits and other compensation related entitlements for all Service Members serving on Active Duty, Reserve and National Guard. Irrespective of actual assignment, the Service Members Branch handles Military Pay. For example, a Service Member assigned to a Combatant Command or Defense Agency; the Parent Military Branch is responsible for the Service Members pay. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) make these payments. The Military Branch coupled with DFAS relies heavily on their internal control process for pre and post payment reviews, entitlement verifications, reconciling management notices, Pay Record Accessibility audit, self-assessment program, and focus metrics program.
The Department’s Civilian Pay PRA incorporates all salary, benefits and other compensation related entitlements for Department Civilians. The Civilian Pay process is dependent upon the built in internal controls for accuracy and timely distribution. The Department has an internal control structure in place for testing time and attendance that provides reasonable assurance that the hours worked, hours in pay status, and hours absent are properly recorded.
The DoD Travel Pay, PRA program incorporates all of the payments made by DFAS, in support of the Military Branches, Combatant Commands and Defense Agencies for Service Members and Civilian Employees for mission required temporary and permanent travel- and/or transportation-related expenses. The Department through DFAS uses a variety of pre and post payment internal controls to identify, prevent and recoup travel overpayments.
The Commercial Pay, PRA program is subject to all of the payments sent to Contractors and Vendors who provided various services and or delivered the required goods as outlined in the agreement or contract. The primary objective of the Commercial Pay Payment Recapture/Recovery Audit program is to recoup all monetary loss associated with payment made to outside Vendors and Contractors. The Department PRA Commercial Pay activities focuses on reporting and correcting any type of monetary loss. As part of the Department’s overall system of internal controls, any overpayments that have been identified in sampled items for the PIIA Compliance Audit are reported to the DoD Component where the transaction originated. The process is similar to when overpayments are discovered through different PIIA audits, reviews and reports. Regardless of the identification source of the overpayment, the Department actively pursues all available methods for recouping erroneous overpayments as part of the overarching PRA program.
DFAS is the sole service provider for the processing and payroll of the Retired and Annuitant populations (R&A) for the Department. DFAS is at the forefront of ensuring the appropriate controls are in place to combat and assist in the mitigation of risk for potential erroneous or improper payments. Based upon the guidance from the Department, DFAS R&A quickly worked to identify and ascertain their processes that are in place to detect, identify and recoup any erroneous payments through its multiple payroll areas. DFAS is well postured to continue to identify the risks associated with payment recapture activities and implement checks and balances as a need arises.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Finance Center (UFC) disburses all of the travel and commercial payments for USACE. USACE discovers overpayments through the contract closeout process, through routine audits and supplemented by the PIIA audit process. The USACE Finance Center Debt Management Office performs the necessary actions to recoup the payment once the overpayment is identified and the bill is created.
The Military Health Benefits PRA program administered and managed by the Defense Health Agency (DHA). The TRICARE program provides healthcare services to 9.4 million beneficiaries. These refunds represent overpayments recovered as a result of payment errors identified through the compliance review process, refunds occurring in the course of routine healthcare claims processing, healthcare claim adjustments or corrections as identified by civilian providers or TRICARE beneficiaries and claim corrections as the result of internal post-payment audits conducted by private sector.

CMS does not collect as much information for this recovery source as the Medicare RACs.  Thus, some information presented in the recovery audit section may only account for information from a subset of the Department's RAC programs.

For Medicaid FFS RACs, the amount recovered also subtracted amounts overturned on appeal or underpayments restored.","2022"

•	The DOI uses FBMS, a consolidated, standardized financial and business management system that provides DOI with the ability to view transactions across all organizational units, see trends and anomalies, as well as monitor risk and metrics DOI-wide. In addition, transaction processing is more standardized, and automated controls are enhanced (i.e., required purchasing approvals, segregation of duties, etc.). 

•	Prepayment Audit of Government Bills of Lading (GBL). The DOI conducts prepayment audits of freight bills via GBL. This effort is required by the Travel and Transportation Reform Act of 1998. Efforts continue with DOI’s Bureaus to ensure that all freight bills undergo prepayment audits.

•	Invoice Payment Reviews. The DOI conducts various pre and post payment reviews of vendor invoices across the Bureaus. The reviews are the responsibility of the Bureaus and are used to identify inaccurate payments and determine the effectiveness of internal controls over the payment process.

•	Travel Voucher Audits. The DOI conducts both pre- and post-travel voucher audits. The audits are designed to identify incorrect payment amounts, unauthorized claims, and internal controls over the payment process.

•	Payment Integrity Center of Excellence (PICOE). The Office of Financial Management (PFM) continued its collaborative approach with PICOE in FY 2022 to identifying actionable solutions as it relates to the Department’s payment integrity challenges.

•	Government Charge Card.  For the FY 2022 internal control cycle, the Office of Acquisition and Property Management required the Department Offices and Bureaus to perform the following charge transaction reviews: Prohibited Purchases; Split Purchases; Tax Exemption; Review Statements and Attached Documentation; Timely Approval of Statements; and Fraud, Abuse, Misuse and Collusion. No significant deficiencies or material weaknesses were identified. 

•	Payment Integrity Monitoring Capabilities. The Department is building its Payment Integrity monitoring capabilities to perform independent assessments and validate results being provided by the Bureaus.

(Unit- Free-Text)","With oversight from the Employment and Training Administration (ETA), each state Unemployment Insurance (UI) agency is responsible for promoting and maintaining UI program integrity through prevention, detection, investigation, establishment, and recovery of improper payments. States identify and establish overpayments for recovery using methods such as crossmatching with the State Directory of New Hires, the National Directory of New Hires, the UI Integrity Center’s Integrity Data Hub, quarterly wage records submitted by employers, matches with databases such as Workers Compensation and incarceration records, and other sources such as tips and leads.

State UI laws provide for overpayment recovery and states are required to follow their individual state laws and policies in executing recovery efforts. ETA requires states to report quarterly on overpayment detection and recovery activities, including information on actual amounts of UI overpayments established and recovered.

States are required to hold claimants liable to repay improperly received benefits and take an active role to recover improper payments. States may waive recovery of non-fraud overpayments when it would be against equity and good conscience pursuant to their state’s law. States may also waive recovery of certain non-fraud overpayments under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, as amended, in accordance with federal guidance (see Unemployment Insurance Program Letter (UIPL) No. 20-21 and 20-21, Change 1). Under no circumstances may a state waive recovery activities for a fraudulent overpayment.

ETA requires states to use the overpayment recovery tools listed below (with citations providing ETA with authority to require such actions):
•	Benefit Offsets (Title II, Subtitle A of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, UIPL No. 05-13);
•	Treasury Offset Program (TOP) (Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, UIPL No. 02-19 and 12-14);
•	Cross Program Offset Recovery Agreement (CPORA) (UIPL No. 05-13); and
•	Interstate Reciprocal Offset Recovery Arrangement (IPORA) (UIPL No. 05-13).

ETA also strongly recommends states use the following additional overpayment recovery activities, where allowed by state law, as part of an effective overpayment recovery operation:
•	State Income Tax Offset Program;
•	Wage Garnishments;
•	Civil Actions;
•	Property Liens;
•	Collection Agency Referrals;
•	Credit Bureau Referrals;
•	Probate and bankruptcy;
•	Referral to DOL-OIG and law enforcement;
•	State/Federal prosecution;
•	Offset lottery winnings, homestead exemptions, and other benefits;
•	Skip tracing;
•	Establishment of interest and penalties on overpayments, which adds an incentive to repay quickly;
•	Negotiating repayment plans; and
•	Accepting repayments through various methods (online, via credit card, etc.).

The frequency and complexity of fraud attacks against state unemployment programs increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. State UI systems were targeted by sophisticated and organized fraud, perpetrated by domestic and international criminal organizations. Fraud schemes continue to evolve to circumvent prevention and detection tools and strategies implemented by states.

(Unit- Free-Text)","The Department of State reviewed potential improper payments provided by the Department of the Treasury as a result of submitting disbursed payments through the Do Not Pay (DNP) portal. In 2022, the Treasury reviewed and disbursed 1,398,882 payments totaling $14.3 billion paid by the Department through the DNP portal. Potential matches were provided on a daily basis, comparing payments to the public Death Master File (DMF) of the Social Security Administration and the General Services Administration’s Excluded Parties List System (EPLS). Through daily access via the Treasury DNP portal, the Department reviewed 170,669 unmatchable payments, totaling $1.5 billion, and adjudicated 74 potential erroneous payment matches as part of the post payment review process. 

The Department continued to utilize the DNP portal’s DMF on a pre-payment basis for all annuitant payments. At least twice each month the Department’s annuitant database is screened against the DMF to identify deceased annuitants. All matches are researched and if confirmed, payment to the annuitant is stopped prior to processing the monthly annuity payment run. In 2022, there were 204,767 annuitant payments totaling $1.1 billion were reviewed against the DMF and 71 payments totaling $320 thousand were stopped due to this initiative. This process is successful in identifying deceased annuitants and ensuring improper payments are not made. In addition, all annuity manual payments processed through Treasury’s Secure Payment System are reviewed through the DMF online search prior to making payment. 

For non-Treasury Disbursing Office oversees payments, payee information is checked against Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control’s (OFAC) list of Specially Designated Nationals (SDN). During 2022, there were 2,501,281 payments totaling $9.2 billion of potential payment matches reviewed resulting in no stopped payments.

In addition, Department grants processed through the Health and Human Service (HHS) Payment Management System (PMS) are included in a DNP review. HHS incorporated a review of the DNP portal into their payment process to identify individuals or entities with delinquent Federal non-tax debt, a recipient that is listed as deceased on the DMF, and recipients excluded from doing business with the government. In 2022, the Department was notified of no recipient that appeared ineligible due to results of the DNP process. In addition, in 2022, two recipient payments were stopped as a result of the Treasury Offset Program (TOP). The TOP is a centralized offset program, administered by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s Debt Management Services, to collect delinquent debts owed to the Federal agencies and states (including past-due child support), in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 6402(d) (collection of debts owed to Federal agencies), 31 U.S.C. 3720A (reduction of tax refund by amount of the debts), and other applicable laws.

(Unit - Free-Text)","Fiscal Service programs- Management has determined that conducting recovery audits would not be cost-effective. Fiscal Service makes payments based on the public law, adjudications, or payment certification from Federal Agencies. Although, a formal recovery audit is not performed, internal reviews are conducted before all payments are made. A justification was submitted to OMB in 2018 to request exemption for reporting recovery audits for this fund group.

Internal Revenue Service Programs-  Per OMB's letter to Treasury Assistant Secretary for Management, dated March 20, 2014, IRS custodial/bond programs are exempt from Payment Recapture Auditing. Treasury determined that it considers these payments negative revenue receipts- not outlays- and thereby exempt them from improper payment requirements. OMB believed this is a reasonable approach, however these custodial/bond programs are still required to assess for risk. IRS programs that are not custodial/bond programs submitted a justification to OMB in 2016 to exempt them from recovery auditing. The five year average cost of recovery auditing far exceeded the average improper payments identified. No improper payments were recaptured through recovery auditing, however, all funds recaptured were identified through normal operating processes and collected through established procedures. Pre-payment reviews are conducted for the purposes of preventing, identifying, and recovering improper payments for contracts, modifications, and task orders.

The Office of International Assistance provided a cost-effective justification to OMB for recovery auditing in 2018. Payments for this fund group can be in two forms: payment vouchers on letter of credit which are administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and direct cash payments via the Secure Payment System. Internal reviews are performed before all payments are made. Management has determined that it would not be cost-effective to perform formal recovery auditing on this fund group.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) submitted a cost-effective justification for recovery auditing to OMB in 2018. The justification was based on the following: The OCCs improper payment risk assessment for the five categories of payments (contract payments - invoices, travel card, purchase card, payroll, and benefits) has resulted in a low risk rating since at least FY 2012. The OCC has strong internal controls over payments as validated by A-123 testing. The OCC conducts ongoing internal reviews of travel vouchers, purchase cards, and other transactions. The OCC performs an annual review using analytic techniques of contract payments to identify potential fraudulent activity or other payment anomalies. The OCC has very low delinquency and unauthorized use rates for government travel and purchase cards and for expenditures of OCC funds outside of prescribed policies and procedures. The most recent payment recapture audit activities conducted required a higher cost in employee resources than the amount recovered.

The Treasury Franchise Fund submitted a cost-effective justification to OMB in 2018. The qualitative risk assessments for this fund group have been low risk since 2013. Prior fiscal year recovery audits before the justification was established yielded .01% of disbursements for this fund group. This fund group conducts pre-payment and post-payment reviews. Because of these reasons, management determined it would not be cost-effective to conduct recovery audits on this fund group.

The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) submitted a cost-effective justification for recovery auditing to OMB in 2019. The basis of this justification is the BEP's risk assessments are consistently low risk for improper payments. Prior fiscal years found that the improper payment dollar amount for BEP equates to .004% of the total disbursements for the program. BEP continues to do pre-payment and post-payment reviews.

Departmental Offices- Economic Stabilization Direct Loan Financing program is at low risk for improper payments. This loan program is unique in that it contains a limited number of recipients. In FY 2020, there were eight recipients that received eight large payments and in total, the program disbursed loans to 35 recipients. Program participants entered into stringent legal agreements per guidance stipulated in the CARES Act and instituted per Treasury. There were significant reviews performed at the onset of the program including several levels of review regarding program loan terms and documentation. Further, given these disbursements are loans, which are closely monitored for potential default, Treasury expects to receive the funds back. As of September 1, 2021, approximately half of the disbursements have been repaid.

Departmental Office- Payroll Support Program- Since there is a payment recovery process instituted within the program’s internal controls system and the risks of improper payments are low, the potential benefit of conducting a separate
payment recapture audit is minimal and would be duplicative. This payment recovery process is comprised of confirming maximum awardable amounts and verifying that the prorated payments are within the established percentages and maximum payments allowed for each program participant. The cost of performing a payment recapture audit would outweigh any potential benefit.

Departmental Offices- Coronavirus Economic Relief for Transportation Services (CERTS)-  The CERTS program identified one instance of overpayment, and one instance of ineligibility, both were 100% recaptured, and represent less than 0.1% of the total program awards. As of August 2022, the CERTS program has since completed all of its awards to recipients and is shifting to the recipient monitoring phase of the program.  Since there is a low prevalence of overpayments and payments to ineligible recipients, and a 100% recapture rate, the potential benefit of conducting a separate payment recapture audit is minimal.  Therefore, the cost of performing a recapture audit would outweigh any potential benefit.  

Departmental Office- Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund (SLFRF)-  In FY 2021 SLFRF identified three overpayments, which were 100% recaptured, and represent less than 1.0% of the total program awards.   In each of these three cases, recipients notified Treasury of the overpayments and were provided instructions on how to return funds to Treasury.  SLFRF worked closely with the ORP Payment Operations team to recoup overpayments and ensure the returned amount was documented accurately in the Oracle SAR report, which serves as the ORP payment system of record.  Since the program has implemented multiple levels of control activities to enhance the frequency and quality of payment integrity review, the risks of improper payments are low and the potential benefit of conducting a separate payment recapture audit is minimal. Therefore, the cost of performing a payment recapture audit would outweigh any potential benefit. 

Departmental Office- Emergency Rental Assistance-  Eligibility for payments from Treasury to participating entities are made by Treasury according to statutory allocations. The payments team uses various systems to validate the information, such as Sam.gov, Oracle, and Salesforce. Initial eligibility of recipients is verified using the Do Not Pay Portal. Payments are approved for disbursement after undergoing a multi-step validation process to verify the recipient, dollar amount, and timing. Once approved, payments are disbursed following the standard ORP payments process. Since the program has implemented multiple levels of review (drawing from multiple data sources) into its internal controls system, the risks of improper payments are low and the potential benefit of conducting a separate payment recapture audit is minimal and would be duplicative.

The payments team uses various systems to validate the information, such as Sam.gov, Oracle, and Salesforce. Initial eligibility of recipients are verified using the Do Not Pay Portal. Payments are approved for disbursement after undergoing a multi-step validation process to verify the recipient, dollar amount, and timing. Since the program has implemented multiple levels of review (drawing from multiple data sources) into its internal controls system, the risks of improper payments are low and the potential benefit of conducting a separate payment recapture audit is minimal and would be duplicative.

Departmental Offices- Emergency Capital Investment Program- During the application phase, ECIP consulted with the primary federal regulators for each applicant (being a regulated financial institution) to confirm that it was eligible to receive funding. The underwriting process was conducted in coordination with teams of community development finance and financial institutions and external financial advisers.  ECIP program management was required to approve each investment decision, based on established procedures which incorporated risk management controls and included multiple layers of review. Since the program has implemented multiple levels of review involving multiple outside and independent assessments, the risks of improper payments are low and the potential benefit of conducting a separate payment recapture audit is minimal and would be duplicative.

Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR)- SIGPR has an established inter-agency agreement (IAA) and service level agreement (SLA) in place with the Treasury’s Administrative Resource Center (ARC) Financial Services program for providing financial support services.  As it relates specifically to recovery processes this includes but is not limited to activities such as performing funds control reviews and maintenance on a weekly basis and review recovery analysis.  ARC has processes in place for financial reporting and reconciliations on a routine basis to identify, prevent and/or recover improper payments based on established thresholds. SIGPR has also developed and implemented policies and procedures to ensure controls over payments are implemented, including daily financial reporting and reconciliations to identify, prevent and/or recover improper payments based on established thresholds. Since there are payment recovery processes included within the aforementioned policies and procedures and the risks of improper payments are low, the potential benefit of conducting separate payment recapture audits is minimal and would be duplicative.

(Unit - Free-Text)","Treasury reports error rates as outlined in the PIIA and OMB Appendix C, for four  refundable tax credits—the EITC, AOTC, ACTC, and net PTC. 

The root cause of the errors in the EITC, AOTC, ACTC, and net PTC RTCs is not the result of internal control deficiencies and, as such, the IRS has continuously deployed costly enforcement tools to lower the error rate.  Deployment of these enforcement tools has had minimal impact on lowering the error rate.  Between FY 2006 and FY 2022, Treasury’s error rates for EITC have ranged from 22.8 percent to 31.6 percent.  As such, we have long held that focusing enforcement resources on the larger tax gap is a more efficient and cost-effective way to minimize the tax gap and maximize tax collections.  We continue to support the reporting of RTC errors as part of the tax gap estimate as a better reflection of how the IRS approaches taxpayer compliance relative to the U.S. tax system.

These RTCs are not “payments” as intended under the improper payments legislation, as the tax system is a collection system rather than a payment system.  Whereas a payment system is generally designed to implement internal controls that provide for appropriate verification and validation prior to payments being made, the statutory structure and design for administering refundable tax credit refunds prevents the IRS from verifying or validating such amounts prior to making a refund.  Consequently, refundable tax credit errors are not the result of internal control weaknesses that we can remediate internally but are, in fact, the result of factors beyond our control under current law and existing authority.  Even if we could obtain legislative changes and invest in additional resources and verification solutions that would ultimately reduce errors, the benefits derived would be marginal relative to the cost of doing so.  As such, it is our position that refundable tax credit refunds that result in errors should not be reported under the improper payments framework.  Rather they are more appropriately addressed in the tax gap estimate, which is how we manage noncompliance.

In fiscal year (FY) 2021, as part of the Debt Management Product, we implemented several improvements to our remittance process.  These enhancements now account for nearly 50 percent of our remittance activity.

In January 2021, we partnered with the Department of the Treasury’s (Treasury) Pay.gov team to implement our first online repayment option for Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance beneficiaries and Supplemental Security Income recipients to repay benefit overpayments via credit or debit card and automated clearing house (ACH); i.e., a checking or savings account.

(Unit - Free-Text)","Federal Student Aid's (FSA’s) Federal Pell Grant (Pell) and William D. Ford Direct Loan (Direct Loan) programs are considered Phase 2 programs per OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C (“A-123C”). The major causes of improper payments (IP) and unknown payments (UP) in FY 2022 are related to misreported income, credit balance deficiencies, incorrect financial aid determination, and student withdrawal deficiencies. These root causes are consistent with those identified for prior year IP and UP estimates. FSA has developed corrective action plans to mitigate and prevent IPs and UPs that are within FSA’s control. For example, FSA is in the process of implementing the authorities provided in the FUTURE Act to directly authenticate applicants’ and borrowers’ income data. IPs and UPs that are outside of FSA’s control are mainly attributed to challenges at institutions that are responsible for disbursing Pell and Direct Loan funds. FSA will continue to provide training to institutions through various avenues, such as the FSA Annual Conference, and perform various oversight activities to ensure institutions meet FSA requirements for institutional eligibility, financial responsibility, and administrative capability.

The FY 2022 IP and UP rates for the Pell and Direct Loan programs are 2.24% and 0.75%, respectively, up from 1.98% and 0.56% in FY21.  The increase in the FY22 estimates over FY21 is primarily due to an increase in technically IP (i.e., where the correct recipient was paid the correct amount, but where not all requirements were met – such with as the untimely calculation or return of Title IV funds).

The Department had three non-FSA susceptible programs in FY 2022. Two of these programs were estimated for the first time and one program experienced an increase in its IP+UP rate since the previous year due to a high number and amount of UP.

The primary driver of the overall improper payment rates of the Department’s susceptible programs (outside of FSA) is unknown payments, or lack of (or insufficient) documentation. Other root causes accounting for a very small percent of improper payments are: Statutory requirements of program not met, Failure to access data/information, and Data/Information needed does not exist.

The amount of monetary loss improper payments due to causes within the Department’s control accounts for a tiny fraction of the amounts that underlie its programs IP rates. There is not enough evidence to point to any systemic or underlying causes other than UPs. Hence, the Department’s efforts will be focused on researching UPs and determining whether they are improper payments or not, so their root causes can be analyzed in the future. To address challenges in obtaining supporting documentation, the Department plans to increase its payment integrity training and education opportunities for both program staff and grantees (payment recipients). The Department identified very few monetary loss improper payments outside of the agency’s control based on its FY 2022 review. However, unknown payments identified in FY 2022 are being researched. 

Only one non-FSA susceptible program, the Title I, Part A program, experienced a decline in payment integrity status this reporting period. This program is in its second year of improper payment reporting, and its reported estimated rate increased from 14.77% in FY 2021 to 35.72% in FY 2022. For this program, the number and amount of unknown payments (improper payments whose root cause is “Unable to determine whether proper or improper”) extrapolated from the testing sample increased from last year to this year.","2022"

(Unit - Free-Text)","Condition 1: The payment of real estate taxes in most leases is designed to be a passthrough from the landlord’s real estate tax bill.  The landlord pays the taxing authority and GSA pays the landlord for its share based on percentage occupancy of the building.  The real estate payment is incorporated into the GSA annual rent payment.  If the actual taxes are more than the amount paid through rent, GSA owes the landlord the difference.  If the actual taxes are less than the amount paid through rent, the landlord owes GSA the difference.  Recoveries arise when Lessor fails to report either of these two scenarios by not sending GSA the appropriate tax bills.    
Resolution 1: GSA has established agencywide procedures to perform annual reviews of all leases when the landlord does not send in taxes.  These procedures have significantly decreased improper payments in this area in the last 4 years.

Condition 2: There are several variables that can cause overpayments at the start up of a lease such as broker commission credits, free rent credits, and credits for holdover payments on a preceding lease, etc.  The overpayments exist if these credits are not entered in the billing system (REXUS) or not properly transferred from the billing system to the payment system (Pegasys).
Resolution 2: Checklists have been developed in GSA's Regions to ensure that all credits are entered into the billing system (REXUS).

In previous years, the Department established a two-part process comprised of a preliminary assessment followed by a comprehensive assessment if necessary. The preliminary risk assessment process is used on all programs not already reporting an improper payment estimate and that meet the minimum disbursement threshold of $10 million. The comprehensive risk assessment process is required based on the preliminary risk assessment results and the program’s three-year risk assessment cycle. In conducting the comprehensive risk assessments, components held meetings with program managers, key personnel, and other stakeholders to discuss the inherent risk of improper payments. The Department’s comprehensive risk assessment involves evaluating attributes that directly or indirectly affect the likelihood of improper payments using the GAO Standards for Internal Control (Green Book) framework as well as OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C guidance. Additionally, the Department conducts independent reviews of Component submissions to identify significant changes in the program compared to last year and assess the reasonableness of the risk ratings.

The Department uses a statistically valid, stratified sample design performed by a statistician to select and test disbursements for those programs identified as susceptible to significant improper payments. DHS procedures continue to strive for an overall estimate of the percentage of improper payment dollars within ±3 percent precision at the 95 percent confidence level. Many of the Phase 2 programs within DHS utilize a stratified random sampling approach where payments are grouped into mutually exclusive “strata,” or groups based on total dollars. To estimate improper payment dollars for the population from the sample data, the stratum-specific ratio of improper and/or unknown dollars to total payment dollars is calculated.

As highlighted through the reported estimates, DHS continues to prioritize corrective actions, as necessary, while also aiming for full compliance with PIIA requirements.

The effects from consecutive hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria were widespread, causing long-lasting damage across the southern continental U.S. and surrounding islands, as well as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Supplemental appropriations were designated as an emergency requirement in the Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements, 2017 (P.L. 115-56, the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act of 201 7 (P.L. 11572), and the Further Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-123) were issued to specific agencies to provide the resources needed to recover and rebuild following recent hurricanes and other applicable natural disasters. Within these supplemental appropriations, DHS received a total supplemental appropriation amount of $50.72 billion. Once disaster supplemental funded programs met or exceeded the $10M threshold in payments applicable for PIIA review, the program was deemed susceptible to significant improper payments and thus applicable for statistical sampling and reporting.

As a result, no additional programs were identified as susceptible to significant improper payment. Prior year improper payment work identified the following three programs as susceptible to improper payments:
•Rental Housing Assistance Program (RHAP) - Tenant Based Rental Assistance (TBRA) Program 
•RHAP - Project Based Rental Assistance (PBRA) Program
•Community Development Fund – Community Planning and Development Public Laws 115-123, 115-56 and 115-72 related to hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria disaster recovery (CPD Disaster HIM) 

HUD was unable to perform testing for Rental  Housing Assistance Program (RHAP)-TBRA and RHAP-PBRA during FY22 due to privacy and security concerns. Due to this scope limitation, HUD is not reporting an error rate for PBRA and TBRA for the FY22 reporting cycle.  Corrective actions to address OIG recommendations pertaining to the publication of IP and UP estimates for TBRA and PBRA were reported in accordance with OMB guidance. 

HUD achieved full payment life cycle testing for CPD Disaster Harvey, Irma, and Maria (HIM) in FY 22 covering FY21 disbursements. Specifically, HUD completed testing for the payments between HUD and the grantee, and the grantee payments to the subrecipients. The full payment life cycle testing for CPD in FY 2022 resulted in an estimated error rate of 0.19 percent ($2.9 million). The error rate is less than the statutory threshold established in OMB Circular A-123 Appendix C, Part II.C.1 (M-21-19) for improper or unknown payments of 1.5 percent of disbursements and $10 million, or $100 million, demonstrating the CPD-HIM program is not susceptible to improper payments and annual testing is not required. Unknown Payments identified for CPD HIM were attributed primarily to timely access to audit documentation. In addition, corrective actions reporting is not necessary for this program due to the very low error rate.","2022"

(Unit - Free-Text)","NASA remains committed to preventing and reducing improper payments through its Payment Integrity Improvement Program (PIIP).  NASA annually conducts a Payment Integrity Risk Assessment and updates its risk assessment methodology to ensure proper assessment activities are conducted. Modifications are made as appropriate with regard to changes to improper payment legislation and guidance, changes to NASA’s operating environment, recommendations from external auditors, and other circumstances. NASA performed its FY 2022 Payment Integrity Risk Assessment employing the updated risk assessment methodology. This methodology incorporates seven risk conditions, each with a set of related criteria designed to account for 11 OMB-designated and NASA-specific risk factors. OMB requires that each agency assess programs or activities deemed not susceptible to significant improper payments at least once every three years. To meet this requirement, NASA extracted the population ($22.2 billion) of FY 2021 disbursements from its financial management system to develop a list of programs eligible to be assessed for the FY 2022 Payment Integrity Risk Assessment. The universe of payments subject to analysis included disbursements to vendors, NASA employees, and other government agencies issued by NASA between October 1, 2020, and September 30, 2021. 

In addition, NASA conducted statistical sampling and testing on the Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Matthew, and Hurricane Irma disaster relief funding activities with disbursements totaling $16.47 million (reported under Disaster Relief Appropriation). The results of the testing yielded no identification of improper payments or unknown payments, thus a 100 percent payment accuracy rate.

Quantitative factors included the analysis of categorized recovery amounts versus the costs to determine if the benefits of establishing a payment recapture audit program would exceed the costs associated with recovery of overpayments.

Therefore, VA implements appropriate recovery activities and audits based on the specifics of the program. The majority of VA's programs conduct recovery audits versus recovery activities.

VA's recovery response is provided at the agency level based on an aggregate of program specific data. As a result, individual program responses may not be reflective of the overall agency response. For example, while VA responded yes to recovery activities, only 21 of 88 programs performed recovery activities in addition to recovery audits. In addition, some recoveries identified by Office of Management and Budget implementation guidance as activities versus recovery audits are so minimal throughout a fiscal year that it would not be cost beneficial to break these out and track separately, therefore, these are included in recovery audit reporting and recovery disposition aligns with recovery audit disposition requirements. Examples include overpayments identified during annual Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 testing for programs reporting improper and unknown payments, recoveries from Qui Tam cases where VA does not receive notification from the Department of Justice that these recoveries were from a Qui Tam case, and some self-reported overpayments. Also, although the majority of VA’s programs are part of the Recovery Audit program facilitated by the Financial Services Center that has a recovery target of 80%, some programs have differing targets dependent upon specifics related to their programs.

In addition, VA totals for the disposition of funds are able to be reconciled to the recovery audit amount for the reporting period; however, recovery audit overpayments identified in the current reporting period that remain outstanding for zero to six months or six months to one year may not reconcile to the difference in the amount identified and amount recovered for the current reporting period.

In making this determination, the Commission considered its low improper payment rate based on testing conducted over the previous three years and determined that the costs of implementing and overseeing a payment recapture audit program, including staff time and payments to contractors, would exceed any benefits or recaptured amounts that might result. 
The Commission utilizes cost-efficient matching techniques to review all vendor payments to identify significant overpayments at a low cost per overpayment. The Commission has not identified a significant number or amount of improper payments since it began its analysis.  
In addition to contract payments, recapture auditing may also be considered for the Commission’s monetary awards to whistleblowers, if determined to be cost-effective, when payments to whistleblowers total more than $10 million annually. The amount of whistleblower awards will vary depending on the number and amount of covered enforcement actions in a given year, as well as the extent of original information provided by whistleblowers that led to the actions. However, the Commission has determined that implementing a payment recapture audit program for monetary awards to whistleblowers would not be cost-effective due to the effective design and operation of the internal controls in place for the program. As noted above, the review of each individual award by the Commission’s Claims Review Staff limits the likelihood that the whistleblower award program would be susceptible to significant improper payments or that payment recapture audits would be beneficial.
The Commission will continue to monitor the potential for improper payments across all programs and activities it administers and assess whether implementing payment recapture audits for each program would be cost-effective.

For FY 2022, $281,235,483 in disbursements were made, of which payroll, benefits, and travel accounted for $223,253,052, and $525,092 were disbursed. Additionally, the NLRB paid $57,457,338 to vendors for about 20% of the total disbursements.

The Agency’s latest IPIA assessment, for FY 2022, and review performed by an independent consultant concluded that the NLRB program and activities were at a low risk for improper payments.

During FY 2022, the Agency performed an independent review that evaluated the procedures in the Agency’s payment and disbursement processes. It also tested and assessed the design and effectiveness of controls. Given these controls, the IPIA assessment found no improper payment in the testing and found that the estimated improper payments to be within the thresholds defined by IPIA. Thus, improper payments for the NLRB’s programs did not exceed $10 million and 1.5 percent of the program total expenditures or $100 million of the total program expenditures. The Agency estimates the improper payments rate to be at most 1.5 percent and the improper payment amount to be no more than $4,218,532.24. 
Therefore, the NLRB has effective procedures and controls in place for its payment and disbursement processes. The NLRB has reasonable assurance that controls over financial and non-financial operations are sufficient. No additional reporting requirements are necessary.

As a result, DNP identified three payments totaling $28,080.84 that required further review because of a death record match. DNP did not identify any payments which matched a vendor name on the Excluded Parties List (EPL).

· Payments reviewed for improper payments includes the total number of payments disbursed by the Agency through the Payments, Claims and Enhanced Reconciliation (PACER) payment system minus any payments that were excluded from matching due to (1) a missing or unmatchable TIN (DMF only) or (2) a missing name.

· Payments stopped is currently not applicable since the DNP matching and adjudication process is based on post payment results.

All payments made in FY 2022 were verified using the method above, except for payments to Federal vendors, payroll, and credit card payments.

The agency continues to attribute progress made in eliminating improper payments to the implementation of the program integrity activities outlined in our “Do Not Pay Implementation Plan.” The plan, which was implemented in FY 2013, requires agency staff responsible for processing invoices to focus on prevention, detection, and recovery. Prevention activities, which are executed prior to the payment of an invoice, include pre-payment audits, risk prioritization, and predictive modeling. Transactions that are identified as being “high risk” are subject to a second level of review prior to being forwarded to the Certifying Official for approval for payment. The Review Commission utilizes the Administrative Resource Center (ARC) for financial services which includes processing payments. Any funds disbursed by the Department of the Treasury go through Payment Integration, in which the Do Not Pay Portal automatically matches all Payment Automation Manager files. Detection activities, which are performed subsequent to payment, are based largely on reports generated by ARC. These reports assist with reviewing invoice processing activities. For example, the Review Commission analyzes a monthly report detailing the cumulative total and number of invoices processed during the previous 30-day reporting period. The Review Commission continued to implement its prevention and detection process in FY 2022.

PIIA requires agencies to review and assess all programs and activities with annual outlays greater than $10,000,000 for improper payment risk at least once every three years to identify those susceptible to significant improper payments.  Because MCC last completed a risk assessment on its programs in FY 2020, MCC conducted a risk assessment on five programs during FY 2023.  These programs are Compact Assistance, Compact Development Funding, Threshold, Due Diligence, and Administrative Fund.  As a result of the risk assessment, MCC identified no programs which are likely susceptible to significant improper payments.  Additional programs were below the $10 million threshold and were not assessed during this period.  MCC will evaluate the programs in FY 2024 to ensure no significant legislative changes and/or significant increase in funding to determine if the agency will need to reassess its risk posture or whether programs moved above the threshold levels set by PIIA.  MCC will continue to maintain a payment integrity environment with strong internal controls and low improper payments.","2023"

FY 2022 testing and review results over government charge cards showed that the USITC can provide reasonable assurance that its internal controls over the use of the cards were operating effectively and that no material weaknesses were found in the design or operations of internal controls over the charge card programs. 

The USITC also tests for improper payments by reviewing a sample of agency invoice disbursements to ensure the correct payment was issued based on the contract award. Test results as well as the agency’s improper payment strategy for testing and payment recovery are documented and submitted to OMB in the Agency Financial Report (AFR) on an annual basis (e.g., FY 2021 Agency Financial Report). 

FY 2022 testing for improper payments showed that the USITC can provide reasonable assurance that its internal control over the payment issuance or receipt of payments was operating effectively and that no material weaknesses were found in the design or operations of the internal controls over disbursement payments.  

In addition, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) reviews the improper payment test strategy and testing to ensure compliance with the Payment Integrity Improvement Act of 2019 (PIIA) (Public Law 116-117) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-123, Appendix C (M-21-19). 

FY 2022, the OIG reviewed the agency’s PIIA compliance and issued their report April 26, 2022. Their review showed that the agency complied with the requirements of PIIA (OIG-MR-22-08). 

In summary, FY 2022 financial control evaluations resulted in no material weaknesses in financial processes that could result in inaccurate financial reporting and testing showed that financial business processes were in compliance with the FAR and PIIA requirements.

(Unit - Free-Text)","For FY 2022, VA is reporting a total of $3.5 billion in projected improper and unknown payments across 7 programs in Phase 2: Beneficiary Travel; Communications, Utilities, and Other Rent; Medical Care Contracts and Agreements; Pension; Purchased Long Term Services and Supports; Supplies and Materials; and VA Community Care. Specifically, VA reports $1.4 billion in monetary loss, $1.56 billion in nonmonetary loss improper payments ($1.7 million in underpayments, $1.56 billion in technically improper), and $550.42 million in unknown payments. In addition, the Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program is reporting monetary loss under $100 million in FY 2022, removing it from high priority program reporting requirements in FY 2023. VA’s reported improper and unknown payments is a reduction of $1.6 billion or 32% from FY 2021 results. It is also important to note that VA efforts to reduce improper and unknown payments outpaced outlay increases of $3.2 billion, or 11%, due to effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies. In addition, for FY 2022, VA is reporting 67 programs in Phase 1 with 47 programs requiring an improper and unknown payment risk assessment. Each of these programs, or 100%, were determined below significant risk of improper and unknown payment thresholds, defined as either 1.5% of outlays and at least $10 million or $100 million or more in total improper and unknown payments.

VA has made great progress in the reduction of improper payments and unknown payments. Since FY 2018, VA has reduced improper and unknown payments by $11.24 billion, or 76% and removed a total of 7 programs from reporting requirements, utilizing mitigation strategies and corrective actions that prioritized the largest proportion of errors and noncompliance with laws and regulations. For FY 2022, 6 of 7 VA programs experienced a reduction with only one program reporting increases. A major contributor to the agency’s overall decrease was within the VA Community Care program. The program reduced overpayments related to incorrect billing vendor and payment processing errors by $1.01 billion from the previous fiscal year by implementing new software to automate eligibility determinations and improve payment processing. Reductions to improper payments and unknown payments is attributed to VA’s robust process to update corrective action plans annually based on testing results, and no less than quarterly throughout the fiscal year, to ensure actions planned are appropriately prioritized and designed to mitigate risks of improper payments and unknown payments. Effectiveness reviews are also conducted annually to measure if actions reduced or were properly designed to reduce improper payments and unknown payments using set benchmarks for specific root causes.

VA prioritizes addressing errors resulting in monetary loss, a total of $1.4 billion, or 40% of reported improper and unknown payments in FY 2022. VA’s highest contributor of monetary losses within and outside of VA’s control occurred within the Pension program due to unreported Social Security Administration income resulting in incorrect payment amounts. These errors accounted for $398.22 million, or 11% of VA’s total improper payments and unknown payments. VA implemented an automated match with Social Security Administration to identify differences in income amounts between social security benefits reported by beneficiaries and social security benefits per Social Security Administration records. Starting September 2022, a large batch of claims identified by the match is sent weekly to claims processors for review and corrective action to include correction of award amounts and recovery of overpayments, if applicable. The VA match with Social Security Administration will also contribute to the mitigation of payment discrepancies outside of VA's control. 

Additional major causes of VA improper payments and unknown payments in FY 2022 stemmed from technically improper payments which accounted for $1.56 billion, or 44%, of VA’s total improper payments and unknown payments. Of the $1.56 billion, approximately $1.02 billion, or 66%, did not meet procurement or statutory requirements because orders were placed by unauthorized individuals or VA was unable to obtain written documentation to support the ordering officer delegation. To remediate these technically improper payments, VA continues to implement process and policy updates to mitigate unauthorized commitments and utilize allowable contracts and agreements to improve compliance.","2022"

The CPD Community Development Block Grant – DRAA-Sandy program monitors disaster recovery activities for Federally declared disaster arepas affected by Hurricane Sandy. The grantee submits a quarterly performance report using the Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting (DRGR) system that is reviewed by CPD field offices or HUD headquarters. The performance reports are used to review the grant expenditures and accomplishments for all CDBG-DR funded activities. The grantee also uses the DRGR system to submit vouchers and drawdown funds. After a voucher is created and submitted by a grantee Drawdown Requester, the voucher line items must be reviewed and approved by the grantee Drawdown Approver. If a line item is approved, it is either sent to the Line of Credit Control System (LOCCS) for processing, or, if the grant drawdown threshold of $5 million has been reached, it is sent to HUD for review and approval before it can be submitted to LOCCS. CPD also monitors the grantee’s efforts to prevent the duplication of benefits and ensure programmatic compliance. 
CPD’s program exhibit 34-1, Guide for Review of Financial Management and Audits, is designed to monitor non-federal entity’s compliance with requirements Subparts D and F of 2 CFR part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, except for cost allowability, procurement, and equipment. The exhibits located in Chapter 6 of the CPD Monitoring Handbook, serve the purpose of capturing improper payments identified in the program file-level reviews during on-site or remote monitoring. If any improper payments are identified the reviewer must indicate on the monitoring exhibit the program area, amount, type of improper payment and the corrective action. The grantee is notified of any improper payments identified during the monitoring review at the exit conference. If the grantee is unable to provide documentation to resolve the improper payment, a finding will be issued in the Monitoring Report which is transmitted to the grantee within 90 days of the monitoring review. In most cases, CPD recaptures overpayments by offsetting future draws. If there are no remaining funds on the grant, HUD typically instructs the grantee to either repay funds from non-federal sources to their grant’s line of credit in LOCCS, or to Treasury’s account if the grant has closed or the funding availability period has expired. Additionally, CPD may also withhold additional funding until the overpayment has been recovered. 
Additionally, HUD monitors all high-risk grantees annually and, in some instances, bi-annually. Although these monitoring engagements do not exclusively include a review of improper payments, the reviewers are able to identify improper payments during the file review. If a grantee must repay HUD, CPD will coordinate with the applicable offices depending on the amount being repaid. A remittance to the line of credit of less than $2,000 may be made by sending a check to HUD-FAD Collections Ft. Worth, whereas any remittance of more than $2,000 must be sent via wire transfer to the Department of U.S. Treasury Financial Communications System (TFCS).

The Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) Administrative and Budget Services manages Transit Subsidy payments. 
For the Payroll, Benefits and Retirement Division (PBRD), OCHCO reviews the unpaid report to ensure all HUD employees are paid based on their certified timecard for the POI 4408. If erroneous payments were made due to an error in personnel and benefits, OCHCO then takes the necessary action(s) to rectify the mistake. For example, OCHCO collaborates with the Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS) and the Department of Agriculture’s National Finance Center (NFC) to run all the necessary reports to determine where the discrepancy was made. Once the source has been identified, OCHCO corrects the issue or determines if it is feasible to correct the improper payment. Through the Payroll, Benefits, and Retirement Division’s (PBRD) quality review process, overpayments are identified and validated. Once validated and corrected through the NFC database, the debt is generated, and the employee is notified of the indebtedness. After due process, the collection process is initiated.
Also, the Human Resources (HR) Division performs a quality review based on the personnel data generated from the NFC FOCUS report or NFC Reporting Center application for personnel and benefits actions. The report data is used to determine if there are any incorrect coverage plans, personnel data or duty locations which will cause an overpayment for the employee. If so, the History Correction Update Processing (HCUP) system is used to correct the error, which will automatically generate a bill if it is within twenty-six (26) pay periods. Outside of the pay period timeframe, HR will manually calculate the amount owed and enter the data to be submitted to NFC via the Special Payroll Processing System (SPPS). The employee will be informed of the indebtedness; and have an opportunity to setup a payment plan.
The Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) provides assistance and advice to HUD program budget offices on improper payroll payments and payroll corrections on an ad-hoc basis and upon request. For other than payroll payments such as travel payments, purchase card payments, contract payments, and Interagency Agreement (IAA) payments, program offices follow the Administrative Control of Funds Policies (Administrative Control of Funds Policies, 1830.2 REV-6) to ensure improper payments are prevented or detected and corrected and OCFO-Budget provides assistance to budget offices upon request. Reports run from HUD’s Financial System (Oracle Business Intelligence/OBI) suite of reports to include the Procurement Request Information System Management (PRISM) and Travel reports, and other payment systems (e.g. Invoice Processing Platform (IPP), Intra.gov, Concur), are used to identify, and sometimes, recover improper non-payroll Salaries and Expenses (S&E) payments. Most program offices have designated individuals to run and review payment reports for discrepancies and improper payments including unauthorized purchases in line with departmental and program office funds control policies. Additionally, program office Contracting Officer Representatives (CORs) ensure invoice payments are proper and made in line with contract guidelines through the use of reports ran through IPP and related OBI reports.
As part of the bi-weekly payroll projection process, OCFO-Budget runs reports from OBI’s repository of payroll reports and flags any payroll corrections or unusual payroll activities for program budget offices. Upon request and on an ad-hoc basis, OCFO-Budget provides assistance in the correction of improper payroll payments by running reports from OBI’s repository of payroll reports (Cost and Hours report) and providing data regarding payroll corrections to program budget offices and Treasury’s Administrative Resource Center (ARC).
OCFO-Budget provides assistance to program budget offices by flagging payroll corrections or unusual payroll activity as part of a bi-weekly payroll projection process. OCFO-Budget also works with program offices and ARC to correct these issues.
Additionally, program Budget office’s work with ARC, HUD OCFO, and HUD’s Office of the Chief Procurement Officer (OCPO) HUD CPO in the payment recapture process as it relates to non-payroll S&E improper payments. For example, program budget office’s work with OCFO’s travel management staff on the recapture of improper payments.
The Administrative Control of Funds Policies Handbook outlines procedures and points to additional guidance program offices follow that can lead to the identification, recovery, and prevention of future improper payments.

(Lead Hazard Reduction – OLHCHH)

During grant execution, the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH) reviews grantee invoices, vouchers and supporting documentation. If an improper payment is identified, the Government Technical Representative (GTR) or the COR, as applicable, provides fund recipients with documentation of the determination of the improper payment, the regulatory, grant-specific, and/or contractual basis for recovering the improper payment, a due date for recoupment, and a due-process opportunity to appeal. The appeal, if made, goes to the Grants Division Director (for grants) or the COR (for contracts), as applicable. Should the request not be appealed, or the appeal denied, and the funding recipient did not refund the improper payment, the matter would be referred to the Office of General Counsel (OGC) for action. 
During the close-out of a grant, if it is determined that a financial error occurred, the grantee is asked to provide an explanation for the problem and, if required by the GTR, the grantee submits a check to resolve the financial shortfall. The COR forwards the check and a letter of explanation to the Budget Officer for the recapturing of funds. 
In addition, the GTR includes a copy of the check and the letter of explanation with the close-out package to the Grants Officer. The Grants Officer documents the returned funds on form HUD-1044 (Assistance Award/Assistance). OLHCHH’s process assures quality spending and monitoring for reimbursable funding. The risks of improper reimbursements are low due to several reasons. OLHCHH is a reimbursement program; the funds distributed are for services that have already been completed and invoiced. Additionally, every three months, grantees submit information on work performed and provide a financial statement using the Federal Financial Report (SF-425), HUD-Part 3 Budget form, and supporting documentation. The SF-425, HUD-Part 3 Budget form, and the LOCCS VRS Request Voucher for Grant Payment (form HUD-27053) must match data in LOCCS and all totals must be the same. Under remote monitoring, a GTR performs a review to ensure accuracy, as needed. On-site monitoring is conducted once a year after a risk analysis is completed and/or high-risk is determined for each grantee. Poor performing grantees are required to submit weekly or monthly reports. During grant execution, the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH) reviews grantee invoices, vouchers and supporting documentation.

The Office of Housing-Federal Housing Administration’s (HSNG–FHA) recovery audit program is part of its overall program of effective internal control over payments. Internal control policies and procedures establishes a system to monitor improper payments and their causes, and includes controls and actions for detecting, preventing, and recovering improper payments. On a recurring basis, these programs generate reports that identify potentially duplicate disbursements. These disbursements are researched, and recovery actions are initiated for payments deemed improper. As part of the recapture audit plan, internal control documents and files are reviewed, and post claim reviews are performed.
Under Title I and Other Debt Collection Guidance Handbook 4740.2, the Financial Operation Center (FOC) is primarily responsible for generic debt collection and customer service activities, including responding to debtor inquiries regarding pay-off, payment plans, compromises, disputes, and appeals. The debt referral package primarily consists of copies of legal documents, mortgages, deeds of trust, judgments and other recorded lien documents, lien assignment documents, repayment agreements, credit reports, correspondence to/from debtors, and compromise agreements and supporting documents.
The Debt Collection Asset Management System (DCAMS) is the application used to support the generic debt collection process. DCAMS is designed to automatically send collection letters, report delinquent debt to credit bureaus and HUD’s Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System (CAIVRS), assess penalties and administrative costs, and refer eligible debts to the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) and Cross-Servicing. Based on predefined criteria and the status of that case as reflected in DCAMS data fields (not later than 180 days after the demand letter), DCAMS is consistently updated to prevent improper referral for TOP offset.
For internal offsets, over-claimed amounts (negative claims) occur when the mortgagee owes FHA. The Single-Family Claims Branch (SFCB) sends billing letters to lenders for the excess amounts claimed and tracks the receivables using the Accounts Receivables Sub-system (ARS). Receivables are established in SFCB’s ARS and identified by an FHA case number. Each FHA case number is further identified by Section of the Act (which is linked to the appropriate fund) and endorsement date. This later date identifies the cohort year. The Holder of record to which the claim funds were originally disbursed is identified in ARS as the debtor, by default. When the receivable is subsequently liquidated by funds remitted by a Mortgagee or by offset, the collected amount is posted to the previously identified FHA case number, Section of the Act, and cohort year.
If a payment is not received from a lender within 90 days, the receivable is offset against subsequent claims by the lender until the full amount of the receivable is satisfied. If a receivable is not satisfied within 120-150 days, it is referred to the FOC in Albany, NY for enforced collection actions. At that time, the FOC officially confirms acceptance of the transfer of an aged delinquent debt, and that receivables have been removed from the ARS with the notation that it has been referred to the FOC for recovery.
Another avenue by which improper payments are recaptured is through Post Claim Reviews for title II Single Family Insurance Claims. A statistical sample of settled claims is reviewed for compliance with FHA servicing and claim filing requirements. A report on findings, is prepared and issued to the individual mortgagee. Mortgagees can refute the findings by providing additional documents before a final report is issued. If the Mortgagee chooses to pay the monetary findings prior to HUD’s issuance of the final report, those funds are deposited to ARS, 
which applies them to the Mortgage Insurance (MI) fund. Upon issuance of the final report, it is referred to the FOC which establishes it as a receivable and tracks it until paid in full. If a lender is overpaid on a Multifamily claim, the Multifamily Claims Branch will demand the overage back from the lender. If the lender fails to respond to their demands, the debt is referred to the FOC for collection. Lastly, for Treasury Cross-Servicing, the collection of generic debt is governed by the Debt Collection Improvement Act and HUD policies (Title I and Other Debt Collection Guidance 4740.2). The Act requires federal agencies to refer eligible delinquent debts to Treasury (for Cross-Servicing and TOP) when the debt is 120 days delinquent.
The Treasury’s TOP allows federal agencies to report delinquent non-tax debt to the Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS). BFS performs computer matching with disbursement data and processes an offset when an appropriate match is determined. After referral, Treasury and its private collection agencies are responsible for contacting the debtor to collect the payment of the debt. The Treasury’s Cross-Servicing is a process used by BFS to refer the debt collection to a private collection agency, among other actions, to collect delinquent debts on behalf of Federal Agencies.
The FOC’s recapture process establishes receivables in DCAMS and issues a demand notice to the debtor(s). If the debt remains unpaid, DCAMS issues a “Notice of Intent” warning regarding enforced collection measures and informs the debtor regarding their due process rights. DCAMS automatically reports information to credit bureaus and CAIVRS. Penalty and administrative cost charges are also automatically assessed if warranted.
If the debt remains unpaid, it is referred to Treasury (within 180 days) for offset via the government-wide TOP and for direct collection action by Treasury and Treasury contracted private collection agencies. Treasury also initiates referral to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for civil litigation and/or initiates Administrative Wage Garnishment (AWG) action if they deem such action to be appropriate.
If Treasury’s Cross-Servicing action is not successful, Treasury “returns” the debt to the FOC. If older than two years, the receivable is written-off and the case is reclassified “currently not collectible.” The FOC keeps the case open if offset via TOP appears fruitful or if other collection measures are applicable (e.g., AWG action by HUD). Otherwise, the FOC terminates collection action, closes the case, and the system issues an IRS Form 1099C “Cancellation of Debt,” the following January if appropriate. Write-off, Termination, close-out, and 1099C issuance can also occur at any point in the above collection cycle if determined appropriate (e.g., debtor is discharged as bankrupt).
Collections from debtors to HUD go to the Treasury Lockbox Network or Pay.gov. Collections from debtors to Treasury or DOJ come to HUD via interagency transfer (i.e., Intra-Governmental Payment and Collection (IPAC)). No matter the route, all payments are posted to the receivable in DCAMS.","2022"
"HUD","ara2_2","[ara2_2]Provide a minimum of 2-4 sentences presenting the justification for the determination that Improper Payments identified in recovery AUDITS are not collectable. (Unit - Free-Text)","","2022"
"HUD","ara2_3","[ara2_3]Provide a minimum of 3-5 sentences presenting the justification for the determination that it is not cost-effective to conduct recovery AUDITS in certain programs. (Unit - Free-Text)","Programs grouped based on justifications for exclusion

Group 1 - Nature of Program
A payment recapture audit would not be cost-beneficial based on the nature of these programs. Collectability is a concern as tenants may no longer be receiving housing assistance when the overpayments are identified, or many may not be able to repay the subsidy with their own resources. HSNG Owners/ Public and Indian Housing (PIH) Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) use the Enterprise Income Verification (EIV) system to verify tenant employment/income information and reduce administrative and subsidy payment errors in accordance with HUD administrative guidance. The program Points of Contact (POCs) use EIV to monitor the owner’s compliance with access and use of the system. However, tenant files are stored locally at each Multifamily property and some RHAP activities are administered by PHAs nationwide. A recovery audit would involve substantial travel costs in addition to staff time. There are also no centralized computer database capturing documents used to support the rental subsidy determinations. Therefore, the cost of any additional attempts to recover improper payments would exceed the benefit of improper payments recovered.

Group 2 - Lack of Empirical Evidence
The results of HUD’s payment integrity risk assessment identified these programs as not susceptible to significant improper payments. There is no empirical evidence, either through risk assessments, A-123 internal control reviews, and other monitoring reviews, that suggests significant improper payments exist within these programs and activities, and it is not likely that HUD would realize any benefit to payment recapture audits of these programs. Therefore, the cost of any additional attempts to recover improper payments would exceed the benefit of improper payments recovered.

Group 3 - Similar Overpayment Recovery Activities for CPD Program
These Community Planning and Development (CPD) funds have a monitoring process in place to assess the quality of performance of the grantee over time and promptly resolve the findings of audits and other reviews. Monitoring provides information about program participants that is critical for making informed judgments about program effectiveness and management efficiency. It also helps in identifying instances of fraud, waste, and abuse. The process involves frequent telephone/email contacts, written communications, analysis of reports and audits, and periodic meetings. Monitoring also provides opportunities to identify program participant accomplishments as well as successful management/ implementation/evaluation techniques that might be replicated by other CPD program participants.
Parties involved include Special Need Assistance Programs (SNAP), Field Offices, Office of Policy Development and Coordination (OPDC), Office of Rural Housing and Economic Development (ORHED), Office of General Counsel (OGC), Budget and OCFO. CPD’s program exhibit 34-1, Guide for Review of Financial Management and Audits, is designed to monitor non-federal entity’s compliance with requirements of Subparts D and F of 2 CFR part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, except for cost allowability, procurement and equipment. During the monitoring process, program expenditures are reviewed to determine if improper payments were made. If identified CPD determines whether the appropriate corrective actions took place. In most cases, CPD will recapture overpayments by offsetting future draws. If there are no remaining funds on the grant, HUD will typically instruct the grantee to either repay funds from non-federal funds sources to their grant’s line of credit in LOCCS or to the Treasury’s account if the grant has been closed. A remittance to the line of credit of less than $2,000 may be made by sending a check to HUD-FAD Collections Ft. Worth PO Box 6200-05, whereas any remittance of more than $2,000 must be sent via wire transfer to the Department of U.S. Treasury’s Financial Communications System (TFCS). CPD programs could also withhold additional funding until the overpayment has been recovered.
In addition, the results of HUD’s payment integrity risk assessment identified these programs as not susceptible to significant improper payments. Therefore, the cost of any additional attempts to recover improper payments would exceed the benefit of improper payments recovered. 

Group 4 - Similar Overpayment Recovery Activities for Ginnie Mae Programs
For any overpayments identified, Ginnie Mae will either request reimbursement or offset future payments to the contractor. However, if there are no future invoices to be provided, Ginnie Mae will request reimbursement for the improper payment. To recover overpayments made to the General Services Administration (GSA) for invoice payments to a vendor, Ginnie Mae will process an IPAC. When the cost of recovering improper payments is greater than the benefits, then Ginnie Mae will not pursue any further actions than mitigating strategies as outlined already. 
As it relates to the PTAP program which is new for 2021, the process for identifying improper payments includes validation of the request against the loan and pool information submitted to the Reporting and Feedback System (RFS), evaluation of the issuers equity and liquidity as reported with the PTAP request, and evaluation of the custodial account balance from which the Investor payments will be drawn.
The PTAP disbursement process is the same as in all Ginnie Mae disbursement requests. The PTAP disbursement request is processed for review and approval for payment. All payment requests are approved by an ICO – Independent Certifying Officer (who accepts personal financial responsibility and criminal liability for improper payments they certify). 
The cost of recovering improper payments would exceed the benefit of improper payments recovered and would not be beneficial to the program.

Group 5 - Similar Overpayment Recovery Activities for Other Rental Assistance Programs
The results of HUD’s payment integrity risk assessment identified these programs as not susceptible to significant improper payments. All owners receiving funding from these programs are mandated by 24 CFR 5.233 to fully utilize HUD’s Enterprise Income Verification (EIV) system. EIV is a web-based application which provides owners with employment, wage, unemployment compensation and social security benefit information for tenants participating in HUD’s assisted housing programs. Tenant Rental Assistance Certification System (TRACS) is a system developed to improve the fiscal control over assisted housing programs and acts as the sole repository of all tenant certification data, assistance contract data and crucial payment data. EIV is matched against TRACS and a variance of $2,400 per year generates an error and owners are required to follow-up with the tenant and resolve the error. If an overpayment is identified, tenants may pay the owner in a lump sum or by entering into a repayment agreement. Therefore, the cost of any additional attempts to recover improper payments would exceed the benefit of improper payments recovered.

(Unit - Free-Text)","Over the past four years, the Environmental Protection Agency has moved from having five of its 10 programs considered susceptible to significant Improper Payments to having none as of the end of the FY2021. 
This year the agency's Office of the Inspector General found the EPA non-complaint with the Payment Integrity Information Act; however, the OIG did not identify any specific programs or payment streams as susceptible to significant improper payments. While the EPA does not agree with the non-compliance findings, the agency has proposed corrective actions that align both with the OIG’s report recommendations and the current steps the EPA is undertaking to carry out enhanced payments oversight due to significantly increased funding (described below). Implementation is under way while the EPA waits to receive a formal response from the OIG on the proposed corrective actions.
In FY2022, the EPA was a part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This bipartisan infrastructure deal will expand access to clean drinking water, provide electric school buses to school districts across America, tackle the climate crisis, advance environmental justice, and invest in communities that have too often been left behind. The EPA received roughly $60 billion (to be distributed over the next five years) in supplementary funding to move out on supporting actions to these objectives. To ensure the proper stewardship of the funding, the Office of the Chief Financial Officer established an extensive program integrity framework which would aid the agency in assessing the risks, implementing internal controls, and preparing for oversight engagements. The goal of the program is to push the planning and control needed to protect the funding early in the life-cycle process. As the program moves into its second year in FY2023, it is an opportunity for the agency to further safeguard its public resources against fraud, waste, and abuse.

"SBA","arp18","[arp18](Optional) Provide any additional information or context about the agency recoveries. (Unit- Free-Text)","The SBA makes every effort to recover improper payments identified during their improper payment review process.  This recovery effort is independent of the recapture audit process, which can be deemed costly and ineffective.  The SBA's process for recovering improper payments commences at the program office where the improper payments are identified.  The agency efforts to recapture improper payments are discussed by program or activity below.
(a) Loan Program Purchases - Overpayments identified in the improper payments’ reviews are recaptured from the lender. The Quality Control staff tracks and collects any monetary overpayment. In some instances, the loan is referred to the Guaranty Denial Team for further action. Determination of a course of action is made on a case-by-case basis, depending on the specific details of the reason for the improper payment. Refer to Part I above for corrective action plans to prevent future improper payments.
7(a) Loan Program Approvals and 504 Loan Guaranty Approvals - Overpayments recaptured outside payment recapture audits are not applicable to 7(a) loan guaranty approval and 504 loan approval as no payment is made at the time of approval. Improper payments identified through the annual improper payment reviews in 7(a) and 504 loan guaranty approvals are resolved through obtaining additional documentation, loan modification, or cancellation of the loan. Improper payments identified as a result of the FY 2021 PIIA reviews have been resolved through obtaining additional documentation, or cancellation or reduction of the loan guaranty and/or referral to other offices within the Office of Capital Access, as appropriate. Determination of a course of action is made on a case-by-case basis, which varies substantially depending on the circumstances of the loan approval and lender’s authority.
Disaster Direct Loan Program - Overpayments are the result of the borrower receiving both an SBA loan and insurance payments or other benefits as a result of the disaster. If the duplication of benefit is recognized prior to the final disbursement, the loan amount is modified to reflect a lower amount and no repayment is required. If the duplication of benefit is identified after the final disbursement of the loan, then the borrower is given 30 days to provide evidence to prove that the disaster loan was not over-disbursed. For example, the borrower can provide documentation demonstrating that insurance funds received did not duplicate the disaster loan purpose. If the borrower has not provided the appropriate evidence within the 30-day period, a demand is made for the over-disbursed funds. Collection efforts continue at the Disaster loan servicing centers, but if these efforts fail, the borrower will still be liable for the over-disbursed amount in the form of monthly payments in accordance with the loan agreement. Thus, any actual loss is the cost of funds related to the over disbursement.
COVID-Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) (COVID-EIDL) - Improper payments are generally the result of loan documentation errors.  Loan documentation legally obligates the recipient of a disaster loan to pay back the entire loan amount whether or not the loan contains any improper payments.  Therefore, improper payments are not recovered upon discovery but realized as the borrower makes each payment on the loan.  
Economic Injury Disaster Loan Emergency Assistance (Advance) (EIDL Advance) - SBA is developing a plan to assess the Emergency EIDL Advances.  SBA will demand repayment for EIDL Advances identified as improper.  SBA will explore available options to remedy cases, including recovery of funds by offset, referral to OIG’s Division of Investigations, or providing supporting documentation where appropriate.  
Paycheck Protection Program Loans - Overpayments are the result of the borrower receiving a PPP loan in an amount that (1) exceeds the borrower’s eligibility, (2) that cannot supported through documentation, or (3) that was not used for purposes permitted by statute or guidance.  In its review of the loan, if SBA determines that the loan is not eligible for forgiveness (in whole or in part), the borrower must begin paying principal and interest.

Under updated improper payment guidance in PIIA, DNP continues helps to protect the integrity of the federal government’s payment processes by assisting agencies in mitigating and eliminating improper payments in a cost-effective manner while safeguarding the privacy of individuals.  DNP enables agencies to use a secure online interface to check various data sources to verify eligibility of a vendor, grantee, loan recipient, or beneficiary to receive federal payments.  DNP enables agencies to screen payment recipients on a pre-payment basis against databases, and also provides post-payment screening against these databases to help ensure that any payments to potentially ineligible parties are identified for adjudication and possible recovery.

During FY 2021, HUD screened 1,457,601 payments against databases, representing $72.66 billion.   The effectiveness of the DNP post payment review of data, coupled with program specific pre-payment monitoring and screening of payments to prevent payments to ineligible parties, has resulted in an observed ineligible party payment rate of 0%.  Management will continue to emphasize review and monitoring of established internal controls to prevent any future improper payments.

"HUD","arp17","[arp17]Provide a minimum of 2-4 sentences discussing the conditions giving rise to Overpayments identified in recovery AUDITS and how those conditions are being resolved. (Unit - Free-Text)","For internal offsets, over-claimed amounts (negative claims) occur when the mortgagee owes FHA.  The Single-Family Claims Branch (SFCB) sends billing letters to lenders for the excess amounts claimed and tracks the receivables using the Accounts Receivables Sub-system (ARS). Receivables are established in SFCB’s ARS and identified by an FHA case number. Each FHA case number is further identified by Section of the Act (which is linked to the appropriate fund) and endorsement date. This later date identifies the cohort year. The Holder of record to which the claim funds were originally disbursed is identified in ARS as the debtor, by default. When the receivable is subsequently liquidated by funds remitted by a Mortgagee or by offset, the collected amount is posted to the previously identified FHA case number, Section of the Act, and cohort year.
If a payment is not received from a lender within 90 days, the receivable is offset against subsequent claims by the lender until the full amount of the receivable is satisfied. If a receivable is not satisfied within 120-150 days, it is referred to the FOC in Albany, NY for enforced collection actions. At that time, the FOC officially confirms acceptance of the transfer of an aged delinquent debt, and that receivables have been removed from the ARS with the notation that it has been referred to the FOC for recovery.
Another avenue by which improper payments are recaptured is through Post Claim Reviews for title II Single Family Insurance Claims.  A statistical sample of settled claims is reviewed for compliance with FHA servicing and claim filing requirements. A report on findings, is prepared and issued to the individual mortgagee. Mortgagees can refute the findings by providing additional documents before a final report is issued. If the Mortgagee chooses to pay the monetary findings prior to HUD’s issuance of the final report, those funds are deposited to ARS, 
which applies them to the Mortgage Insurance (MI) fund. Upon issuance of the final report, it is referred to the FOC which establishes it as a receivable and tracks it until paid in full. If a lender is overpaid on a Multifamily claim, the Multifamily Claims Branch will demand the overage back from the lender. If the lender fails to respond to their demands, the debt is referred to the FOC for collection. Lastly, for Treasury Cross-Servicing, the collection of generic debt is governed by the Debt Collection Improvement Act and HUD policies (Title I and Other Debt Collection Guidance 4740.2).  The Act requires federal agencies to refer eligible delinquent debts to Treasury (for Cross-Servicing and TOP) when the debt is 120 days delinquent.
The Treasury’s TOP allows federal agencies to report delinquent non-tax debt to the Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS).  BFS performs computer matching with disbursement data and processes an offset when an appropriate match is determined. After referral, Treasury and its private collection agencies are responsible for contacting the debtor to collect the payment of the debt. The Treasury’s Cross-Servicing is a process used by BFS to refer the debt collection to a private collection agency, among other actions, to collect delinquent debts on behalf of Federal Agencies.
The FOC’s recapture process establishes receivables in DCAMS and issues a demand notice to the debtor(s).  If the debt remains unpaid, DCAMS issues a “Notice of Intent” warning regarding enforced collection measures and informs the debtor regarding their due process rights. DCAMS automatically reports information to credit bureaus and CAIVRS. Penalty and administrative cost charges are also automatically assessed if warranted.
If the debt remains unpaid, it is referred to Treasury (within 180 days) for offset via the government-wide TOP and for direct collection action by Treasury and Treasury contracted private collection agencies. Treasury also initiates referral to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for civil litigation and/or initiates Administrative Wage Garnishment (AWG) action if they deem such action to be appropriate.
If Treasury’s Cross-Servicing action is not successful, Treasury “returns” the debt to the FOC. If older than two years, the receivable is written-off and the case is reclassified “currently not collectible.” The FOC keeps the case open if offset via TOP appears fruitful or if other collection measures are applicable (e.g., AWG action by HUD). Otherwise, the FOC terminates collection action, closes the case, and the system issues an IRS Form 1099C “Cancellation of Debt,” the following January if appropriate. Write-off, Termination, close-out, and 1099C issuance can also occur at any point in the above collection cycle if determined appropriate (e.g., debtor is discharged as bankrupt).
Collections from debtors to HUD go to the Treasury Lockbox Network or Pay.gov. Collections from debtors to Treasury or DOJ come to HUD via interagency transfer (i.e., Intra-Governmental Payment and Collection (IPAC)). No matter the route, all payments are posted to the receivable in DCAMS.

Based on additional cost beneficial analysis, DHS has examined the program structures, payment types and transaction volume, success rates in recoupment, as well as the expected cost incurred examining labor costs, clearance and equipment costs, commission payments, etc.  Cost analysis reviews conducted to date have not successfully determined that any of the programs would be cost beneficial for recovery audit efforts. DHS continues to refine the information within the analysis, and if determined to be cost effective, will work through procurement channels to move forward with establishing a recovery audit mechanism going forward.","2022"

Additionally, the SBA conducted a risk assessment for an additional 20 programs, with all 20 programs identified as being not susceptible to significant improper payments. 
From FY 2021 to FY 2022, SBA added three new programs to the total number of programs reporting improper payment estimates.  The three new programs are all COVID-19 pandemic related programs, added as a result of new legislation. 
Of the seven programs reporting improper payment data, the most prominent root cause identified was related to the statutory requirements of the program not being met.  The other root cause identified relates to the failure to access data and/or information needed.  
The SBA’s business model of delegating approval authority to lenders to process loans and evaluate an applicants eligibility for the loans directly relates to the root cause of the improper payments.  As such, some of the corrective action plans developed to address the improper payments include working with lenders to ensure statutory requirements are understood and implemented, collaborating with other offices within the SBA to monitor lender deficiencies, and requesting and obtaining any missing documentation in a timely manner.  To ensure root causes are addressed, the SBA has developed rigorous corrective action plans to ensure timely remediation of any improper payments identified.","2022"

This is evidenced by VA reporting four consecutive years of reductions in improper payments – a reduction of $11.2 billion or 76%  These efforts have also allowed VA to remove a total of seven programs from reporting improper payments during this same timeframe.  Below are some of our highlights on activities occurring across the Department to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent as intended and VA fulfills this nations promise to its Veterans.

Veterans Health Administration
Veterans Health Administration attributes the significant reduction in and prevention of improper payments over the last four years to agency-specific efforts such as the development of 50 plus business rules and artificial intelligence built into the claims processing system that allows claims that meet all rules to auto-adjudicate without human intervention. Improper payments are identified on a continual (real-time) basis in multiple systems at multiple levels throughout the life-cycle of a claim from when the medical provider/third party administrator submits the claim, the claim processing through the VA source system and into VA's Program Integrity Tool, and then back to the VA source system for payment and adjudication. Pre-payment control logic includes, but is not limited to, duplicate checks, aberrant billing patterns, and List of Excluded Individuals and Entities.

Veterans Benefits Administration
As part of Veterans Benefits Administration Do Not Pay - Activities, multiple internal and external activities outside of the Treasury Working System are in place that focus on the prevention of overpayments. Veterans Benefits Administration receives continuous information from several Federal agencies, which it uses to verify the status of Veterans Affairs beneficiaries. This information identifies instances where there may be inconsistencies between VA records and data furnished by other Federal agencies that may affect entitlement to Compensation and Pension benefits. The following describes the various agreements:

1) Fugitive Felon Match - The Office of Inspector General entered into a computer matching agreement with law enforcement agencies for a list of individuals with felony arrest warrants to match against VA records, identifying beneficiaries that might be fugitive felons. 

2) Social Security Verification Match - Once a year, the Social Security Administration provides information on Social Security Administration rates for recipients of VA Pension and Parents' Dependency and Indemnity Compensation to verify reported income.

3) Social Security Administration Prison Match - The Social Security Administration provide VA with Information on prisoners. Periodically, data from Compensation and Pension records are run against Social Security's inmate database to identify VA beneficiaries who may be subject to reduction or termination of benefits. The Bureau of Prisons Match provides Veterans Benefits Administration with information on Federal prisoners. On a monthly basis, Compensation and Pension files are matched with Bureau of Prisons' inmate database to identify incarcerated beneficiaries, which may require a reduction of termination of benefits. The Social Security Death Master File from the Social Security Administration provides VA a list of deceased individuals. On a weekly basis, Compensation and Pension records are matched with the Death Master File to identify possible deceased beneficiaries to determine if benefits need to be terminated. 

Financial Services Center
The Financial Services Center leverages data available within the Treasury Working System via Computer Matching Agreements with the United States Department of Treasury to continually update the vendor file used to store payee information for individuals and vendors doing business with VA.  Potential matches are identified in the file to be used if invoices/claims are submitted from matched individuals and vendors in the future. The Financial Services Center is continuing the partnership with the United States Department of Treasury to utilize additional data that will improve customer service, to include reducing the time it takes to validate new or changes to existing vendor information. This partnership and use of data made available to the United States Department of Treasury by various federal agencies will improve VA’s ability to stop future potential improper payments in a pre-payment state.","2022"

At VA, these audits are performed in five major areas: Veterans Health Administration for several unique programs providing health care, Veterans Benefits Administration for benefit programs where the Financial Services Center in Austin, Texas does not process their payments, the Financial Services Center which provides recovery audits for all payments it processes which includes Veterans Health Administration payments, some Veterans Benefits Administration payments, National Cemetery Administration payments, and VA's Staff Offices (for example, Office of Information Technology, Office of Management, and the Office of Human Resources & Administration/Operations, Security & Preparedness), as well as specific recovery audits performed by the Office of Inspector General's additional shared service providers for payroll and Supply Fund payments in the Office of Revolving Fund. These are discussed in more detail below.

Veterans Health Administration
Veterans Health Administration is operationalizing a recovery audit contract which will audit claims from FY 2018 through FY 2023 for Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration Spina Bifida Health Care, and VA Community Care programs. The review includes inpatient claims paid under the following authorities: 38 U.S.C. § 1703 (authorized care); 38 U.S.C. § 1728 (service connected unauthorized care); and 38 U.S.C. § 1725 (non-service connected emergency care) and will test to ensure the care rendered is in compliance with the authorization/referral; was reimbursed based on the appropriate methodology; and that the medical records support the diagnostic related group billed for the services.

Veterans Benefits Administration
Veterans Benefits Administration uses a combination of quality reviews and payment reviews to identify possible duplicates and overpayments. The majority of Veterans Benefits Administration programs perform quality reviews on randomly selected cases that ensure eligibility determinations, proper case processing, and payment accuracy. For all other programs, Veterans Benefits Administration performs payment reviews to identify potential duplicate payments and other potential improper payments. Veterans Benefits Administration tracks, monitors, and recovers overpayments eligible for recovery through combined efforts of the multiple VA Offices.

Financial Services Center
The Financial Services Center, a franchise fund (fee-for-service) organization, provides required recovery audit services to Veterans Health Administration, National Cemetery Administration, Veterans Benefits Administration, and VA Staff Offices. VA Staff Offices include but are not limited to the Office of Inspector General, Office of Acquisition Logistics and Construction, Office of Human Resources & Administration, Office of Information Technology, and Office of Management.

The Financial Services Center’s recovery audit program is focused on detection and recovery of overpayments for each program the Financial Services Center services that expends $1 million or more annually. The Financial Services Center reviews current and past payments in database portals to identify and recover improper payments such as duplicate payments, payments made in the incorrect amount, unapplied credits, etc. The Financial Services Center works with its customers to process bills of collection for identified improper payments.

Office of Inspector General
For improper payments that originate with payroll services, the Office of Inspector General works with two Office of Management and Budget Human Resources Lines of Business Shared Services Providers for its recovery audit requirements: the Bureau of Fiscal Services (Department of Treasury/Bureau of Fiscal Services), and the National Finance Center (Department of Agriculture/National Finance Center). Payroll overpayments and debt can arise for a variety of reasons including salary overpayments due to corrected timecards or personnel actions, debts arising from health and life insurance premiums or “buy backs” of employee leave, and administrative debts at the request of the agency.  The Bureau of Fiscal Services will automatically recalculate employee pay to recover overpayments related to corrected timecards and personnel actions. This process includes a Notification of Salary Overpayment to current employees and a Demand for Payment Notice to separated employees. The National Finance Center leads recovery efforts for overpayments that arise for all other reasons. If these efforts are unsuccessful, the debt is transferred to the United States Department of Treasury debt management for collection.

Office of Revolving Funds
The Office of Revolving Funds collaborates with the Office of Inspector General to perform recovery audits on VA's Supply Fund program. The Office of Inspector General identifies an overpayment and a bill of collection is then prepared by the Office of Revolving Funds with appropriate terms of collection. If the vendor chooses to dispute the bill of collection VA will work towards appropriate resolution.

(Unit - Free-Text)","Over the past decade, laws and regulations governing the identification and recovery of improper payments have evolved to strengthen improvements in payment accuracy and raise public confidence in Federal programs. The Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA), as amended and expanded by other related laws, collectively required agencies to periodically review all programs and activities to identify those susceptible to significant improper payments, to conduct payment recapture audits, and to leverage Government-wide Do Not Pay initiatives.

The IPIA regulations also required extensive reporting requirements. In recent years, OMB transformed the improper payment compliance framework to create a more unified, comprehensive, and less burdensome set of requirements. IPIA was repealed and replaced by the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA), which was passed on March 2, 2020. The PIIA modified and restructured existing improper payments laws to help agencies better identify and reduce any money wasted as a result of improper government payments. Not all improper payments are fraud, and not all improper payments represent a loss to the government. Generally, an improper payment is any payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount under a statutory, contractual, and administrative or other legally applicable requirement. The Department defines its programs and activities in alignment with the manner of funding received through appropriations, as further subdivided into funding for operations carried out around the world. Risk assessments over all programs are done every three years. In the interim years, risk assessments evaluating programs that experience any significant legislative changes and/or significant increase in funding will be done to determine if the Department continues to be at low risk for making significant improper payments at or above the threshold levels set by OMB. The Department conducted a risk assessment of all programs and activities in 2022, including the following programs: American Compensation; Foreign Locally Employed Staff Compensation; Foreign Service Annuities; Voluntary Contributions; Assessed Contributions; Post-Assignment Travel; Temporary Duty Travel; National Endowment for Democracy; Economic Support Fund; Diplomatic Policy and Support; Diplomatic and Support Programs; Diplomatic and Consular, Terrorism related; Consular and Border Security Programs; Consular Information Technology and Security; Capital and Real Property Acquisitions Programs; Leaseholds and Functional Programs; Diplomatic and Consular, Other Programs; Overseas Programs; Worldwide Security Protection; International Security and Nonproliferation Programs; Security - Afghanistan, Pakistan; Physical Security Programs; Information Technology Central Fund Embassy Operations; Construction; Project Construction - Major Rehabilitation; International Security Programs; Population Refugees and Migration Programs; International Cooperative Administrative Support Services; Working Capital Fund Programs; Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative; Fulbright Program; Citizen Exchange Program; Educational Programs; Aviation, Anticrime, Interdiction and Related Programs; and Peace-Keeping Operations Programs. After performing risk assessments for these programs, the Department determined that none of its programs in 2022 were risk-susceptible for making significant improper payments at or above the threshold levels set by OMB.

Annually, the Department submits data to OMB that is collected and presented on https://paymentaccuracy.gov/ by individual agency or on a Government-wide consolidated basis. This website contains current and historical information about improper payments made under Federal programs, as well as extensive information about how improper payments are defined and tracked. Please refer to the https://paymentaccuracy.gov/ website for detailed results from the Department’s efforts in 2022 to comply with PIIA.","2022"

(Unit - Free-Text)","We meet the recovery activities program requirements of Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 for our benefit programs.  We have no plans to conduct payment recapture audits or contract for a private sector payment recapture auditing firm because of the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs complexity.  We conducted extensive market research prior to deciding not to use external auditors.  We put out a Request for Information and received approximately 15 responses.  We interviewed all of the respondents, who agreed that they could not match our benefit payments internal controls and audit mechanisms because of the complexity of our programs.  The average claims representative (our principal benefits reviewer, authorizer and adjudicator position) receives an average of 13 weeks of training prior to entering the job and does not achieve journeyman status until they have been on the job for three years.

We have a comprehensive debt collection program.  We collected $4.275 billion in OASDI and SSI benefit overpayments in fiscal year (FY) 2022 at an administrative cost of $0.06 on average per dollar collected.  We collected $20.162 billion over a 5-year period (FYs 2018–2022).  To recover overpayments, we use internal debt collection techniques (i.e., payment withholding, billing, and follow up), as well as some external collection techniques authorized by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 for OASDI debts and the Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 for SSI debts.  From 1992–2022, our external collection techniques have yielded $3.497 billion in benefit overpayment recovery.

We developed a system to use the Treasury Offset Program (TOP), credit bureau reporting, and Administrative Wage Garnishment collection mechanisms for delinquent debts.  Because the system includes more than TOP and is the basis for any future collection interfaces with outside agencies or entities, we call it the External Collection Operation system.

We are making improvement in other aspects of our debt collection program.  In FY 2018, we began modernization efforts to build a new Debt Management System.  This information technology investment is a multi year effort that will build a comprehensive overpayment system enabling us to record, track, collect, and report our overpayments more efficiently.

The Federal Government uses the reclamation process to recover benefit payments paid via direct deposit to the financial account of a beneficiary who died and is not entitled to the payment, became legally incapacitated, or who died before the date of the payment(s).  To recover OASDI and SSI payments from U.S. financial institutions, we must send reclamation requests within 120 days of the date we learn of a beneficiary’s death.  A financial institution may protest a recovery of funds if we did not initiate the reclamation timely.

For Administrative Payments, our current recovery activities program is a proven cost-effective means for evaluating payment accuracy and identifying IPs.  In 2013, we contracted with a private sector recovery auditing firm on a contingency fee basis to review our administrative payments.  The firm based its review on past industry experience of IP rates, and a cost/benefit analysis of transactions processed by type and dollars paid.  Because of their minimal recovery, the auditors terminated the contract.","2022"

These are 1) the Employment and Training Administration - Federal State Unemployment Insurance (UI) program, 2) the Employment and Training Administration - Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program, and 3) the Office of Workers' Compensation - Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) program. Two UI benefit programs created in response to the Pandemic, the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC) and the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC) both provide payment integrity reporting as part of the UI program. 

The PUA program was determined ""susceptible"" in FY21.  DOL submitted a Sampling and Estimation Methodology Plan for estimating the PUA program’s improper payment rate and amount to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 0n June 30 2022. In October 2022, OMB requested that DOL conduct further analysis of the outcomes recorded through the PUA case review process.  OMB and DOL agreed to collaborate in conducting this additional analysis, but it can not be completed in time to meet this year’s reporting deadline, therefore, OMB allowed additional time  to conduct this analysis and report on the PUA program outcomes in FY23.

All Pandemic-related UI programs (PUA, PEUC, and FPUC) expired in law on 9/6/2021, though some states stopped offering these benefits prior to that date. None of these programs provided benefits for weeks of unemployment in FY22. 

DOL conducts a program inventory annually, and conducts risk assessments of all identified programs on a minimum triennial basis as required by M-21-19. No new DOL programs were identified in FY22, nor were any existing programs newly determined to be ""susceptible to significant IP"".","2022"

"SSA","exs1","[exs1] Provide an executive summary of the payment integrity activities and results for the agency for this reporting period (SEE - 'Helpful Hint' - minimum length requirements vary depending on Agency status). (Unit - Free-Text)","Program integrity workloads are critical to ensuring efficient programs and accurate payments in our Old-Age and Survivors, Disability Insurance (OASDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs.

Based on our fiscal year (FY) 2021 stewardship reviews (FY 2022 stewardship information will be available in summer 2023), we estimate that we paid approximately $1.1 trillion to OASDI beneficiaries.  Of that total, we estimate almost $2 billion were overpayments, representing approximately 0.17 percent of outlays.  We estimate that underpayments during this same period were $518 million, the equivalent of approximately 0.05 percent of outlays.  In the OASDI program, we are maintaining a high payment accuracy rate and have been meeting our reduction target for improper payments for the last three consecutive years.

Our greatest payment accuracy challenges occur within the SSI program.  SSI is a means-tested program for individuals with limited income and resources who are blind, disabled, or aged.  Administering the SSI program is complicated by the statutory requirement for us to determine SSI eligibility and calculate SSI payments monthly.  We generally make SSI payments on the first day of the month for eligibility in that month.  Many factors influence SSI payment accuracy.  Even if a payment was correct when paid, subsequent changes in that month can affect the payment due, resulting in either an overpayment or underpayment.  Thus, the program requirements themselves sometimes cause improper payments.  Improper payments often occur if recipients (or their representative payees on their behalf) fail to timely report changes in any of their eligibility factors (e.g., an increase of their resources or a change in their wages).  Failure to report changes is the primary cause of both overpayments and underpayments.  
Based on our FY 2021 stewardship reviews (FY 2022 stewardship information will be available in summer 2023), we estimate that we paid approximately $56 billion to SSI recipients.  Of that total, we estimate about $4 billion were overpayments, representing approximately 7.2 percent of outlays.  We estimate that underpayments during this same period were $873 million, the equivalent of approximately 1.6 percent of outlays.

Of the estimated $4 billion in overpayments, approximately $3.8 billion was due to factors outside of our control because the data or information to validate payment accuracy prior to making payment does not exist or is inaccessible to us.  The primary cause of these overpayments is reliance on timely self-reporting of employment and wage information.  We are addressing this root cause by conducting quality reviews and cost-effective program integrity work including SSI non-medical redeterminations.  To reduce the reliance on self-reporting, we continue to expand and pursue new data exchange partners from government and private sectors.

Approximately $265 million in overpayments were within our control and due to our failure to access data or information to validate payment accuracy prior to making a payment.  The primary causes of these overpayments are incorrectly computing the payment or failure to obtain or act on available information affecting the payment.  We are addressing this root cause by investing in information technology modernization to provide our employees with user-friendly systems and tools.  To meet the challenges of our growing workloads and provide the best service possible, we are streamlining our policies and procedures, issuing reminders to technicians, and automating more of our business processes.

We implemented the Improper Payments Alignment Strategies (IPAS) to focus on our corrective actions to address the root causes of improper payments in both OASDI and SSI programs.  As part of our IPAS, we evaluate the effectiveness of each completed mitigation initiative.  Additionally, we determine the most cost-effective strategies to remediate the underlying causes of payment errors and monitor, measure, and revise the strategies as needed.","2022"

Improper Payments Risk Assessment Process

The Department annually assesses the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, in compliance with OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C. Furthermore, as scheduled, the assessment includes reviews of internal controls over various disbursement processes. The most recent reviews performed indicated that internal controls over various disbursement processes were sound.
Each of the Department’s bureaus/reporting entities periodically completes or updates, over a one to three-year period (depending on the size of the entity), improper payments risk assessments covering all of its programs/activities as required by OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C. These improper payments risk assessments of the entity’s programs/activities also incorporate improper payments risk assessments every three years of the control, procurement, and grants management environments.

Improper Payments and Recaptures of Improper Payments

The Department has extensive payment integrity monitoring, minimization, recapturing, and corrective actions efforts in place, including the identification of improper payments through bureau post-payment reviews, the Department’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) audits or reviews, Single Audit Act audits of grants/cooperative agreements, other grants/cooperative agreements audits or reviews, contract closeout reviews, grants/cooperative agreements closeout reviews, other audits or reviews, and sample reviews of Department-wide sustained disallowed costs.

The Department’s bureaus report improper payments and related recaptures information (recaptures information for improper payments of $10 thousand or more) to the Department’s Office of Financial Management (OFM) on a quarterly basis. OFM then tracks the improper payments of $10 thousand or more that have not been fully recaptured, and periodically throughout the fiscal year requests updates from the responsible bureaus on tracked, unrecaptured improper payments.

OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C provides guidance for agencies to determine if cost-effective payment recapture audits can be performed. The Department had been performing, from 2005 through June 2017, primarily with contractor assistance, annual payment recapture audits of contracts/obligations for many of the Department’s bureaus/ reporting entities on a rotational basis. Annual payment recapture auditing was additionally performed by a contractor, effective 2011, for Department-wide grants and other cooperative agreements (i.e., financial assistance).

The Department continues to periodically evaluate if there are any categories of disbursements for which payment recapture auditing could be or could become cost-effective.

Improper Payments Statistical Sampling and Estimation Process

On February 9, 2018, the President signed into law the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which included supplemental appropriations to many federal agencies for disaster relief purposes. The Economic Development Administration (EDA) was appropriated $600.0 million and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was appropriated $400.1 million.

For FY 2022, the Department was required to submit statistical sampling and estimation plans to OMB and perform statistically valid sampling for FY 2021 disbursements of the above noted disaster relief funds received by both EDA and NOAA, because the FY 2021 disbursements of these funds for each bureau exceeded $10.0 million. The Department complied with all requirements through the services of a contractor.

The two payment streams reviewed for FY 2022 were Payments to Contractors and Multiemployer Financial Assistance Payments. In performing the risk assessments, PBGC considered factors specified in statute and further defined in OMB guidance, including the complexity of the payment stream; the volume of payments; recent major changes in program funding, authorities, practices, or procedures; the level, experience, and quality of training for personnel responsible for making program eligibility determinations or certifying that payments are accurate; whether the program is new to the agency; whether payments or payment eligibility decisions are made outside of PBGC; significant deficiencies in the audit reports issued by the PBGC Office of Inspector General (OIG) and the Government Accountability Office (GAO); similarities to other programs that have reported improper payments (IP) and unknown payments (UP) estimates; the accuracy and reliability of IP and UP estimates previously reported for the program; whether the program lacks information or data systems to confirm eligibility; and the risk of fraud as assessed by the agency under the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government published by the Government Accountability Office.

Based on the results of the Phase 1 risk assessments, PBGC determined that the Payments to Contractors and Financial Assistance Payments payment stream were not susceptible to significant risk of improper payments as defined by the law and OMB implementation guidance.

Any amounts determined through an audit not to have been spent according to CCDF statutory or regulatory provisions, or the approved State Plan, must be repaid to the Federal government. Regardless of whether the state is able to recover the funds, improperly spent funds are already subject to disallowance. Further, CCDF regulations require States to recover child care payments that are the result of fraud. These payments are to be recovered from the party responsible for committing the fraud. HHS believes that these efforts are more efficient and effective than conducting recovery audits, given the nature of the program and other recovery methods in place.

For all other ACF programs, ACF promotes the economic and social well-being of families, children, individuals, and communities.  Recovery of improper payments would potentially harm the communities served by ACF's programs.  Also, for many of the programs recovering funds from states, organizations, and individuals that provide these services may reduce the ability to support the needs of vulnerable, underserved, and low-income beneficiaries of these services.","2022"

"DOI","exs1","[exs1] Provide an executive summary of the payment integrity activities and results for the agency for this reporting period (SEE - 'Helpful Hint' - minimum length requirements vary depending on Agency status). (Unit - Free-Text)","Payment Integrity and Phase 1 Risk Assessments

On March 5, 2021, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued an update to Appendix C of Circular A-123 (Appendix C) in OMB Memorandum M-21-19 Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement. Appendix C requires agencies to review all programs and activities for the risk of improper payment by performing assessments to determine whether those programs are “susceptible to significant improper payments.” Due to the DOI’s historic low risk of improper payments, the DOI conducts comprehensive risk assessments on a three-year cycle of all agency programs with payments greater than $10 million during the assessment period (In Cycle Risk Assessment). With OMB concurrence, DOI utilizes an alternative annual assessment period from quarter 4 of the prior fiscal year through quarter 3 of the current fiscal year. 

In FY 2018, based upon OIG audit recommendations, the DOI launched a new SharePoint tool to assess the susceptibility of programs to significant improper payments utilizing a qualitative risk analysis. In FY 2021, DOI rebuilt the PIIA SharePoint consistent with OMB’s FY 2021 Appendix C update. The new PIIA SharePoint utilizes the thirteen risk factors identified in Appendix C to assess a program’s susceptibility to improper payment. For FY 2022, the DOI utilized a risk assessment methodology that equally weighs the thirteen Appendix C risk factors to yield each program’s overall score as either high, medium, or low risk of susceptibility to significant improper payments. In addition, DOI considers the results of reviews under the Single Audit Amendments Act of 1996, the CFO Act, GAO reviews, and OIG audit reviews when making its assessment of program risk.

In FY 2022, the OIG determined the Department was compliant with the PIIA and Appendix C reporting requirements including the agency’s FY 2021 Off Cycle payment integrity Phase 1 Risk Assessments of (25) new programs. In its report, OIG made two recommendations for the Department including: (1) Reassess the use of an equally weighted qualitative factor approach in its payment integrity risk assessment methodology to determine if it is appropriate and provides reasonable assurance that it will identify programs at high risk of improper or under payment; and (2) Revise the payment integrity risk assessment methodology to include sufficient justification for the approach selected and used. DOI concurred with the OIG recommendations, and in FY 2023 will reassess the Department’s equally weighted qualitative risk factor approach to our payment integrity risk assessments and will implement applicable updates to our Payment Integrity SharePoint site.

In FY 2022, DOI completed an In Cycle Appendix C Phase 1 Risk Assessment of all DOI programs with over $10 million in outlays for the assessment period of Quarter 4 of FY 2021 through Quarter 3 of FY 2022 (assessment period). A total of one hundred and ten (110) program risk assessments were performed in the PIIA SharePoint, with a total of $28,109.33 million in outlays for the assessment period. The 110 risk assessments included eight (8) embedded programs funded through Pandemic Relief legislation with a total of $225.95 million in outlays for the assessment period. None of the 110 risk assessments performed in FY 2022 resulted in a program being identified as being at high risk of susceptibility to significant improper payments, with no new programs requiring Appendix C Phase 2 Testing in FY 2023. 

Payment Integrity and Phase 2 Statistical Sample Testing

DOI is required to design and implement appropriate statistical sampling and estimation methods to produce statistically valid improper payment estimates for all programs and activities determined to be “susceptible to significant improper payments” through Appendix C Phase 2 Testing. DOI employs a testing methodology using statistical sampling to estimate the amount and percentage of improper payments based on the prior year’s program expenditures. In developing its sampling and estimation plans, DOI consults with a certified statistician to ensure its testing methodology will produce statistically valid improper payment estimates. 

In FY 2020, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 initiated a Phase 2 Statistical Sample Testing requirement for DOI programs funded under the “emergency supplemental appropriations to respond to and recover from recent hurricanes, wildfires, and other disasters” (DRA program). In FY 2020, the DOI performed Phase 2 Statistical Sample Testing of the DRA program’s FY 2019 expenditures that resulted in an overall error rate of 0.07 percent with a statistically estimated $.0185 million in improper payments against total program outlays of $27.44 million. These results were achieved with a precision rate of 1.58% with a 95% confidence level. The testing of the DRA program established a baseline improper payment rate of 0.07 percent for this program, significantly below the statutory threshold required for continued Phase 2 Testing of the program. Consistent with Section II.C.3. of Appendix C (see Table 2 and page 19 of M-21-19). In FY 2021 and continuing in FY 2022, the Department moved from Phase 2 Testing of the DRA program to Phase 1 risk assessment of DRA funded programs with greater than $10M in expenditures for the current assessment period.

The Hurricane Sandy Disaster Relief Act is the only other DOI program currently identified as susceptible to significant improper payments in OMB Memorandum M-13-07. In FY 2016, DOI performed statistical sampling of the Hurricane Sandy FY 2015 program expenditures and projected an improper payment rate of $565 thousand or 0.41% out of a total $137 million in program payments. Due to the program’s low estimated improper payment rate, with OIG concurrence, DOI requested and was granted relief from OMB reporting requirements including further sampling and estimation. As a result, Phase 2 Testing does not apply to DOI for the Hurricane Sandy Relief Act program and is excluded accordingly.

DOI’s FY 2019 through FY 2021 Appendix C Phase 1 Risk Assessments found no program at high risk of susceptibility to significant improper payments requiring Phase 2 Testing in FY 2022; and as noted above, no program was identified for FY 2023.

DOI's Appendix C internal controls and monitoring over the payment process in FBMS and GrantSolutions business and payment systems are reviewed on a regular basis and remain effective.  The minimal amount of overpayments across all agency programs when DRA and other programs underwent Phase 2 Testing validate that the agency's OMB A-123 internal control procedures and commitment to established risk reduction measures are both appropriate and effective.

Retirement & annuitant pay (issued by DFAS) is currently in the process of enrolling into DNP with the anticipated implementation in FY24. Amongst the three agencies currently enrolled in DNP, the Department uses the online search, payment integration, and batch matching features of DNP on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.  The majority of the flagged payees are based on the Death Master File and the name match results from the rest of the DNP databases (e.g., System for Award Management).  The Department researches all payments that are identified to be potentially improper. Research has determined that the majority of these match results are false positives (e.g., a vendor’s tax identification number is matched to a deceased individual’s social security number, and the payment is erroneously flagged).  The remaining matches are almost always deemed proper based on established business rules related to contracts terms and vendor performance (as payments cannot be stopped to vendors who performed properly under contractual agreements).  The Department has historically adjudicated and deemed proper all potential improper payments identified using the DNP Portal.  To date, the DNP initiative has not reduced the Department’s improper payments.","2022"
"DOD","exs1","[exs1] Provide an executive summary of the payment integrity activities and results for the agency for this reporting period (SEE - 'Helpful Hint' - minimum length requirements vary depending on Agency status). (Unit - Free-Text)","The Department of Defense met the overarching intent of the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-123 Appendix C by making Payment Integrity a top management priority in developing effective methodologies to help identify, prevent, and recover improper payments. The Department achieved five out of six PIIA compliance criteria, which is a substantial improvement from previous PIIA Compliance Audits. Specifically, the Department increased the compliance criteria from four in 2020 to five in the 2021 PIIA compliance audit by achieving PIIA Compliance number 5, reduction targets, during the most recent PIIA Compliance audit. 

The DoD Office of Inspector General (OIG) concluded that the Department's previous estimates were unreliable and caused primarily by using an inappropriate variable, which led to insufficient sample sizes and incomplete universe of transactions (UoT) to pull the Payment Integrity sample population for testing. The Department has since implemented several DoD OIG recommendations such as: performing UoT reconciliations for the Payment Integrity Programs to solidify the Sampling and Estimation Plans and creating a Payment Integrity Risk Appetite Statement to verify the effectiveness of the population to create the samples from. Additionally, the Department Payment Integrity teams have collaborated and have a specific formula that has been approved by the DoD OIG to produce more reliable estimates and sufficient sample sizes by testing higher and lower risk payment types accordingly. This new formula and process is anticipated to produce more reliable estimates and streamline the Department’s efforts to achieve compliance with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 during the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 Payment Integrity compliance audit.

There are currently 12 programs that comprise the DoD’s payment integrity portfolio, including: United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Travel Pay, and USACE Commercial Pay, and Military Health Benefits - Administrative which are currently in Phase 1 and will perform risk assessments in FY2023, Civilian Pay, Commercial Pay, Military Health Benefits - Healthcare, Military Pay - Army, Military Pay - Navy, Military Pay - Air Force, Military Pay - Marine Corps, Military Retirement, and DoD Travel Pay which are in Phase 2.
	
If the Department had reliable estimates and established baselines in FY 2021 based on the FY 2022 PIIA review the following four programs would have automatically moved to Phase 1: Commercial Pay, Military Pay – Navy, Military Pay – Air Force and Military Pay – Marine Corps. The majority of Improper Payments for the Civilian Pay program were attributed to Technically Improper Payments (IPs) caused by one overseas pay office. The root cause was immediately addressed and corrected in FY 2022. The Military Pay – Army has demonstrated continuous progress over the years but is still logistically working through ensuring the correct key supporting documentation is housed within the appropriate repository making them readily available for audits. The DoD Travel program’s IPs / Unknown Payments (UPs) increased principally due to the unfamiliarity with the Department’s requirements related to official government travel because of previous travel restrictions during COVID; the Department conducted several significant training sessions to mitigate this deficiency. Military Health Benefits – Healthcare continued to reduce their IP’s from FY 2021 to FY 2022 but is above the statutory threshold. The Department will restructure the Military Health Benefits – Healthcare program to align to the specific individual contract performance requirements and characteristics in FY 2023. The Military Retirement program had a significant increase in projected monetary loss outside the agency control based on a timing discrepancy between processing payments for retirees and deceased notifications received and processed accordingly. The Department is creating an interagency working group with the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Treasury in FY 2023 to address these issues and to create solutions in reducing improper payments. Additionally, the Department created five new corrective action plans.
	
The Department has worked diligently with the Defense Finance Accounting Service and the DoD Components to identify $1,459.09 million specific to monetary losses or overpayments and recovered $1,393.97 million, which demonstrates proper stewardship of funding through the Department’s Payment Recovery Audits and Activities program.

(Unit - Free-Text)","We do not believe it is cost effective to conduct recovery audits in the existing programs.  As outlined below, potential improper payments are subjected to further analysis based on the amount of the payment, the nature of the potential error, and other risk factors to determine whether amounts are due to PBGC.

Benefit Payments disburses over $5 billion in payments annually to over 800,000 participants each month. Due to the dollar value, payment volume, program complexity, and nature of pension payments, PBGC has implemented electronic data analysis, including death match and other procedures, to identify payments that may be in error. Potential improper payments are subjected to further analysis based on the amount of the payment, the nature of the potential error, and other risk factors to determine whether amounts are due to PBGC. PBGC has established procedures to recapture overpayments through recovery payments, installment repayment agreements, offsets against other continuing benefits to recoup amounts owed by the participant, or referrals to the Department of Treasury’s Centralized Receivables Service. In some cases, recapture of payments may not be sought based on demonstration that a participant is experiencing financial hardship or other reasons.

Contractor Payments includes the disbursement of over $300 million annually. Due to the dollar value, payment volume, and the nature of contract payments, PBGC has implemented electronic data analysis, including do not pay matching and other procedures, to identify payments that may be in error. In addition, invoice reviews are periodically performed to help assess the accuracy of amounts billed. Potential improper payments are subjected to further analysis based on the amount of the payment, the nature of the potential error, and other risk factors to determine whether amounts are due to PBGC. PBGC has established procedures under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to seek reimbursement from contractors that have been overpaid. Further, under the FAR, previous payments are made are generally subject to adjustment based on over or under payments and any amounts due are normally addressed prior to or at contract closeout.

Payments to Federal Employees includes disbursement of about $150 million annually. PBGC’s payroll and other employee payments are processed by the Department of the Interior’s (DOI) Interior Business Center (IBC). PBGC receives a Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 18 report that reports on the DOI IBC payment operations. No weaknesses related to payroll and other employee payments were reported in the most recent SSAE No. 18. Included in PBGC’s and DOI’s internal controls are that a series of personnel actions are needed to change salaries or process bonus payments. Also, employees receive a payroll statement every two weeks. While mistakes can occur in any operation, PBGC has not experienced significant levels of improper payroll payments. Also, if a mistake is identified, any overpayments can be netted against or offset future payments to those employees or deducted from the last paycheck processed after termination. A review of the following did not identify significant payment issues:
>Improper payment risk assessments,
>agency Inspector General reviews,
>Government Accountability Office reports, and
>results of the agency audit resolution and follow up process.
Given the historic low risk nature of payroll disbursements, including the existence of adequate payment processing controls and reviews, and the ability to readily recover any improper payments by offset against future payments through normal payroll operations, establishing a separate payment recapture program for this payment stream is unnecessary and would not be cost effective.

Multiemployer Plan Financial Assistance includes disbursement of over $160 million per year. MEPD generally processes an average of 357 financial assistance payments annually to an average of 95 plans. Multiemployer plans are required to provide proof of plan insolvency, sign promissory agreements, and undergo an initial audit to determine if the plan is eligible to receive ongoing assistance from the PBGC. Additionally, multiemployer plans are required to provide documentation to support estimates of future expenses prior to receiving financial assistance on a yearly, semi annually, quarterly, or monthly basis.
The PBGC’s Multiemployer Program Division (MEPD) reviews all financial assistance requests in accordance with established policies and procedures to verify requests are reasonable, complete, accurate, and comply with ERISA. MEPD rejects or reduces the amount of financial assistance requested by plans if the administrative and/or benefit expenses do not agree to supporting documentation or if there was a prior overpayment. Additionally, throughout the year, plans submit documentation to support actual expenses incurred to validate a plan’s previous estimate of plan expenses and adjust the most recent financial
assistance request amount if the actual amount of expenses significantly varied from the plan’s initial estimate, and MEPD auditors review this documentation and perform a detailed reconciliation. Multiemployer plans are insolvent and generally have no other sources of financial resources beyond PBGC. In addition, there are just over 100 plans, so this is not a large universe of payees to monitor
within the existing structure. A review of the following did not identify significant payment issues:
>improper payment risk assessment
>agency Inspector General reviews,
>Government Accountability Office reports, and
>results of the agency audit resolution and follow up process.
Given the lower payment dollar value and volume, the nature of the multiemployer plan financial assistance program, payment processing controls, and the ability to adjust future financial assistance amounts by actual expenses incurred, establishing a separate payment recapture program for this payment stream would not be considered cost effective.

Premium Refunds issued ranges roughly $88 to $203 million on an annual basis. All premium refund requests are subject to review prior to disbursement with larger payments subjected to additional approvals. Given that each pension plan has an ongoing account with PBGC as to premium amounts due, any adjustments for under or over payments can be reflected in the PBGC’s Statement of Account for each plan. Plans may contest any attempt to recapture overpayments. A review of the following did not identify significant payment issues:
> Improper payment risk assessments,
> agency Inspector General reviews,
> Government Accountability Office reports, and
> results of the agency audit resolution and follow up process.
Based on above and especially since there is not significant dollar value or payment volume associated with this payment stream, establishing a separate payment recapture program for this payment stream is not considered cost effective.

(Unit - Free-Text)","In FY 2022 AmeriCorps saw a decline in its improper payment rate in one of its four susceptible programs. The increases in the improper payments rate from last year to this year are largely attributed to the operational challenges that grantees continued to face related to the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically related the administration of the temporary pay allowances that AmeriCorps allowed during the period reviewed. The COVID 19 temporary pay allowances impacted the Foster Grandparent and Senior Companion Programs. Increases in the RSVP program are attributed to insufficient or unsupported salary allocations, specifically the grantee’s inability to properly document staff time and effort on the federal award. 
AmeriCorps State and National experienced a decrease in its improper payment rates from last year to this year. The rate decrease can be attributed to fewer instances of large improper payments. 

All agency improper payments are deemed outside the agency’s control. Although AmeriCorps is responsible for recipient eligibility determinations, once grant funds are obligated, payment and eligibility determinates are made at the grantee level.  
As part of its strategic plan, AmeriCorps is prioritizing effective stewardship of federal resources. 

The agency specifically targeted improper payments and has created goals and objectives aimed at reducing improper payments rates. A major step in this effort is the establishment of an agency-wide Payment Integrity Corrective Action Plan working group, which includes accountable program officials and key agency stakeholders. Utilizing the Payment Integrity Assessment data, the working group created a corrective action plan which defines goals and deliverables and identifies responsible parties for carrying out key actions. The corrective action plan is monitored for progress and refined as needed. The establishment of the working group represents a coordinated effort by the agency to develop and implement corrective actions aimed at reducing improper payments.

"CFTC","exs1","[exs1] Provide an executive summary of the payment integrity activities and results for the agency for this reporting period (SEE - 'Helpful Hint' - minimum length requirements vary depending on Agency status). (Unit - Free-Text)","On March 2, 2020, the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) repealed the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA), the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 (IPERA), the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act of 2012 (IPERIA), and the Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015 (FRDA).  PIIA is comprehensive payment integrity legislation that incorporates all prior payment integrity legislation into one Act. PIIA is implemented by OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C, Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement. Appendix C requires Federal agencies to perform a risk assessment and review of each low-risk program and activity at least once every three years to identify programs that may be susceptible to significant improper payments, perform statistically valid testing of programs considered high risk, and develop and implement corrective action plans for high-risk programs. 

The Commission has identified two programs—Operations and Administration and Whistleblower Payments—that have annual outlays exceeding $10 million.  The Commission performs a risk assessment for both of its major programs every three years as required by OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C.  The last risk assessment was completed for both programs in October 2022 covering FY 2022 outlays for the period October 1, 2021, to September 30, 2022.

As part of each risk assessment, the Commission reviews the risk factors for improper payments and completes a Risk Score Card for each program. The risk factors considered by the Commission include how long the program has been in operation; the complexity and volume of disbursements transactions; source of payment eligibility decisions; recent major changes in program funding, authorities, practices, or procedures; level, experience, and quality of training for personnel responsible for making program eligibility determinations or certifying that payments are accurate; and whether there have been any significant deficiencies disclosed in the audit reports of the Commission. 

Each of these risk factors are evaluated against the Commission’s internal controls and assessed by testing key internal controls as part of the Commission’s robust Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act of 1982 (FMFIA) internal controls process. A score of High, Moderate, or Low risk is assigned to the overall risk for each program as well as the likelihood and impact of an improper payment. In the last risk assessment, both the Operations and Administration and Whistleblower Payments programs were identified as having a moderate risk of making an improper payment. For the Operations and Administration program, this assessment was due to the complexity of the program, the volume of payments made annually, payment decisions delegated to regional offices, and training required for personnel. For the Whistleblower Payments program, this assessment was due to the complexity of the program, a change in the process for funding payments, and training required for personnel. 

For FY 2024, CFTC’s most significant payments were for payroll and benefits for its employees, which are administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Finance Center (NFC) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and payments to vendors for goods and services used during normal operations. CFTC’s other most significant payments are for monetary awards to eligible whistleblowers who voluntarily provided the CFTC with original information about violations of the CEA that led the CFTC to bring enforcement actions that resulted in monetary sanctions exceeding $1 million.  

Significant erroneous payments are defined as annual erroneous payments in the program exceeding both $10 million and 1.5 percent, or $100 million of total annual program payments.  Although the Commission disbursed $48.5 million in whistleblower payments during FY 2024, the review of each individual award by the Commission’s Claims Review Staff as well as multiple approval levels limits the likelihood that the whistleblower award program would be susceptible to significant improper payments. In addition, based on the results of transaction testing applied to a sample of FY 2024 vendor payments, consideration of risk factors, and reliance on the internal controls in place over the payment and disbursement processes, the Commission has determined that its programs and activities carried out in the normal course of business have a low risk of being susceptible to significant improper payments at or above the threshold levels set by OMB.

Appendix C of Circular A-123 states that the Commission is not required to determine a statistically valid estimate of erroneous payments or develop a corrective action plan if the program is not susceptible to significant improper payments. Appendix C also states that if a low-risk program experiences a significant change in legislation and/or a significant increase in its funding level, agencies are required to re-assess the program’s risk susceptibility during the next annual cycle, even if it is less than three years from the last risk assessment. The Commission regularly reviews any changes to its programs in between preparing formal risk assessments to identify whether a new risk assessment should be conducted.","2024"

"CFTC","ara2_3","[ara2_3]Provide a minimum of 3-5 sentences presenting the justification for the determination that it is not cost-effective to conduct recovery AUDITS in certain programs. (Unit - Free-Text)","The Commission determined that implementing a payment recapture audit program for contract payments is not cost-effective. In making this determination, the Commission considered its low improper payment rate based on testing conducted over the previous three years and determined that the costs of implementing and overseeing a payment recapture audit program, including staff time and payments to contractors, would exceed any benefits or recaptured amounts that might result.

The Commission utilizes cost-efficient matching techniques to review all vendor payments to identify significant overpayments at a low cost per overpayment. The Commission has not identified a significant number or amount of improper payments since it began its analysis. In addition to contract payments, recapture auditing may also be considered for the Commission’s monetary awards to whistleblowers, if determined to be cost-effective, when payments to whistleblowers total more than $10 million annually. The amount of whistleblower awards will vary depending on the number and amount of covered enforcement actions in a given year, as well as the extent of original information provided by whistleblowers that led to the actions. However, the Commission has determined that implementing a payment recapture audit program for monetary awards to whistleblowers would not be cost-effective due to the effective design and operation of the internal controls in place for the program.
As noted above, the review of each individual award by the Commission’s Claims Review Staff and multiple approval levels limit the likelihood that the whistleblower award program would be susceptible to significant improper payments or that payment recapture audits would be beneficial.

The Commission will continue to monitor the potential for improper payments across all programs and activities it administers and assess whether implementing payment recapture audits for each program would be cost-effective.","2024"

AmeriCorps has drafted the language to include in the FY 2025 terms and conditions and will continue to recover monies for collectable improper payments. 

AmeriCorps had audit findings that it did not publish accurate or valid rates for ASN or FGP because it does not include differences between filed Federal Financial Reports and general ledgers as improper payments. The OIG recommends AmeriCorps reconcile the difference between grantees’ internal account records and Federal Financial Reports or to have the grantees perform the reconciliation during the payment integrity testing cycle and report unmatched errors as unknown payments. AmeriCorps does not agree that unmatched reporting errors represent improper payments as grantees have until the close of their award to reconcile its accounting records. AmeriCorps does not concur with the findings that resulted in the reported noncompliance. 

AmeriCorps also received a finding that the National Service Trust (NST) improper payment rate should have been reported in FY 2023. AmeriCorps did not concur with this recommendation, as it reperformed a susceptibility analysis in FY2023 to deem the NST susceptible, per an audit recommendation. Therefore, NST was not required to be reported until FY2024.

The Commission has integrated the solution into existing processes as part of its efforts to identify and prevent improper payments. The Commission’s shared services provider utilizes the DNP Business Center, on the Commission’s behalf, to perform online searches and screen payments against the DNP databases to augment data analytics capabilities. 

All non-payroll payments disbursed by the Commission are processed through the DNP portal, including payments to whistleblowers and travel reimbursements to Commission employees.  As of October 21, 2024, 3,277 FY 2024 payments totaling $149.9 million were processed through the DNP portal, representing 100.0 percent of all non-payroll payments disbursed by the Commission.

(Unit - Free-Text)","In fiscal year 2024, AmeriCorps is reporting three programs in Phase 2 including AmeriCorps State and National (ASN), the Foster Grandparent Program (FGP), and the National Service Trust. The scope of testing for ASN and FGP includes grantee payments made in Q3 and Q4 of FY 2023 and Q1 and Q2 of FY 2024. The National Service Trust’s (NST) testing scope is disbursements that occurred in FY 2023. 

None of the ASN or FGP improper payments made are within the agency’s control and a majority of improper payments are due to inadequate record keeping and calculation errors. AmeriCorps will reinstitute a corrective action plan committee to address these root causes in FY 2025.

The ASN program had a slight decrease in improper payment rates from FY 2023 which is attributable to variations in testing results from random sample. 

AmeriCorps observed a significant increase in its FGP program. This increase was a result of noncompliance identified with National Service Criminal History Checks (NSCHC). Additional corrective actions will be implemented in FY 2025.

The National Service Trust was in its first year of phase 2 testing as a result of a finding in AmeriCorps’ Compliance with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 for FY 2023 audit. The majority of NST testing included members (ASN) whose onboarding and service is managed and verified externally to the agency by grantees as well as a subset of members (NCCC, some VISTA) whose onboarding and service is managed and verified by the agency. The improper payment rate is well under the $10M threshold and will not be reported in FY 2025.

For programs that utilized Treasury’s Invoice Payment Processing (IPP) system, the payment off-set can be utilized to off-set the overpayment amount against a to-be paid invoice to the same vendor in the system. In addition, the Treasury reclamation process is used once a receivable established to recover an overpayment has aged and can be referred for Treasury collection processing. DHS widely utilizes the accounts receivable process to generate a receivable that then prompts a collection notification process.

In previous years, the Department established a two-part process comprised of a preliminary assessment followed by a comprehensive assessment if necessary. The preliminary risk assessment process is used on all programs not already reporting an improper payment estimate and that meet the minimum disbursement threshold of $10 million. The comprehensive risk assessment process is required based on the preliminary risk assessment results and the program’s three-year risk assessment cycle. In conducting the comprehensive risk assessments, Component personnel held meetings with program managers, key personnel, and other stakeholders to discuss the inherent risk of improper payments. The Department’s comprehensive risk assessment involves evaluating attributes that directly or indirectly affect the likelihood of improper payments using the Government Accountability Office (GAO) Standards for Internal Control (""Green Book"") framework as well as OMB Circular No. A-123, Appendix C guidance. 

Additionally, the Department conducts independent reviews of Component submissions to identify significant changes in the program compared to last year and assess the reasonableness of the risk ratings. In accordance with OMB Circular No. A-123, Appendix C guidance, programs that are in Phase 2 and are preforming statistical testing and reporting do not need to be subject to a risk assessment process and will continue to be considered susceptible to significant improper payments until the program can be reverted to Phase 1.

DHS concurred with both recommendations and at the time of the OIG compliance report publication, the recommendations were considered open and resolved. Overall, DHS, at a summary level, is taking the following actions to resolve the OIG recommendations:
•	DHS will complete the PIIA Phase 2 assessment over the FY 2021 disbursements made by the FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo program and publish an error estimate as part of the Department’s FY 2024 reporting.

(Unit - Free-Text)","In the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Congress passed the Homeland Security Act (P.L. 107-296), which established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and combined the functions of 22 Federal departments and agencies with broad responsibilities to secure the Nation from threats. Since its inception, the Department has evolved into the third largest Cabinet agency and has matured its mission areas to collectively prevent attacks, mitigate threats, respond to national emergencies, and preserve economic security. The threats to our homeland have evolved over the 21 years of the Department of Homeland Security. One constant is the legacy of service of our workforce. They’ve delivered results for America every day since 2003 and continue to contribute to a safer tomorrow for all Americans. 

While we continue to face the threat of international terrorism, new threats and challenges have emerged, including increasing incidents of targeted violence, cyberattacks and several natural disasters, as well as the unprecedented level of transnational organized crime in our hemisphere. The 260,000-strong DHS workforce uses its skills and expertise to meet the challenges of today’s world and prepare for the threats of tomorrow, responding with new programs and capabilities, cross-Component collaboration, and unflinching dedication to the mission: to secure the nation from the many threats we face. Today, DHS spans over two dozen agencies and offices that work collaboratively to protect the American public in the air by securing air travel; on land by securing the border, responding to natural disasters, protecting critical infrastructure, and administering our nation’s legal immigration system; at sea by protecting our coastline and waterways; and in cyberspace by bolstering America’s cyber defense and investigating cybercrime. As the complex threat environment continues to evolve and loom, the Department will embody the relentless resilience of the American people to ensure a safe, secure, and prosperous Homeland supported by the six overarching homeland security missions that make up our strategic plan: 

1.	Counter Terrorism and Homeland Security Threats 
2.	Secure United States (U.S.) Borders and Approaches 
3.	Secure Cyberspace and Critical Infrastructure 
4.	Preserve and Uphold the Nation's Prosperity and Economic Security 
5.	Strengthen Preparedness and Resilience 
6.	Champion the DHS Workforce and Strengthen the Department 

We face more serious threats from nation states now than at any time in the Department's history. DHS is bringing together its authorities and capabilities across DHS Component agencies to counter those threats, including enforcing U.S. trade laws banning the importation of goods made, wholly or in part, with forced labor, strengthening maritime governance, and increasing awareness of nation state threats with our federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, and private sector partners. The nation also faces threats from the impacts of climate change causing more frequent and severe weather events, and from emerging infectious diseases. 

In 2017, the nation faced a historic Atlantic hurricane season. The effects from consecutive hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria were widespread, causing long-lasting damage across the southern continental U.S. and surrounding islands, as well as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Supplemental appropriations were designated as an emergency requirement in the Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements, 2017 (P.L. 115-56), the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-72), and the Further Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-123) were issued to specific agencies to provide the resources needed to recover and rebuild following recent hurricanes and other applicable natural disasters. Within these supplemental appropriations, DHS received a total supplemental appropriation amount of $50.72 billion. Per the language of the supplemental appropriations, once disaster supplemental funded programs initially met or exceeded the $10 million disbursement threshold for payments applicable for Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) review for the 12-month reporting period, the program was deemed susceptible to significant improper payments and thus applicable for statistical sampling and reporting. Since the Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements disbursement activity began, the Department has identified and monitored programs that have expended more than $10 million in applicable outlays in any given fiscal year (FY). 

In 2020, our Nation faced one of the biggest threats in recent history—the COVID-19 pandemic. In a swift response, Congress provided $2 trillion in supplemental funding through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, an economic relief package. As the executer of over $45 billion in CARES Act funding, DHS was at the epicenter in the Federal Government’s response to the pandemic and worked closely with other federal agencies, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments to distribute the much-needed funding. In FY 2020, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated the National Response Coordination Center (NRCC) in the wake of the Coronavirus outbreak in the United States. The NRCC is a multi-agency center that coordinates the overall federal support for major incidents and emergencies. NRCC also provides a clearinghouse of resources and policies for local and state governments in impacted regions. 

In FY 2021, DHS Components received over $50 billion in funding from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) with the majority allotted to the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). The DRF is an appropriation used to direct, coordinate, manage, and fund eligible response and recovery efforts associated with domestic major disasters and emergencies. In addition, the FEMA DRF received over $19 billion from the Consolidated Appropriations Act (CAA) to carry out disaster relief activity, including COVID-19 related activity. 

FEMA provided front-line support for the U.S. response to the pandemic through mass vaccination sites and providing coordination across the FEMA regions. The COVID-19 Pandemic Operational Guidance issued during the 2020 Hurricane Season, outlines how FEMA has adapted its response and recovery operations in a COVID-19 environment. At the same time, this guidance has other implications moving forward, for example, providing a workforce mix for any future scenarios similar to the response during this pandemic. The Pandemic Operational Guidance also helps to shape a shared understanding among local and regional emergency managers and FEMA about roles and expectations in such deployments. The pandemic impacts current and future requirements for response and recovery logistics and products, such as determining eligible work and costs for non- congregate sheltering in response to a Presidentially declared emergency or major disaster, processing grants, how to manage communications, and training during such responses, and employing tools requiring limited on-site presence—such as satellite imagery—to assess damage. 

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-123, Appendix C, “Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement”, serves as the implementing guidance to ensure that legislative requirements within PIIA are sufficiently addressed. Per OMB Circular No. A-123, Appendix C, agencies should assess all programs with annual outlays greater than $10 million for improper payment risk at least once every three years to determine whether the total annual Improper Payments (IPs) plus Unknown Payments (UPs) collectively for each program are likely to be above or below the statutory threshold for the given year. As part of the DHS risk assessment process, all programs are subject to a preliminary risk assessment which serves to determine if the program has been subject to significant changes, fluctuations, new requirements, etc. that could have substantially altered the program’s susceptibility to making significant improper payments, even in off-cycle years. If the preliminary risk assessment indicates a need to reassess the risk of the program or if the program is due for an updated assessment due to the three-year frequency cycle, DHS will then move the program into the comprehensive risk assessment process. In 2024, DHS completed a comprehensive risk assessment for 48 programs out of the over 90 programs that exceeded $10 million in annual outlays. Upon completion of the comprehensive risk assessment process, only one program was determined to be newly susceptible to significant improper payments and will be converted to Phase 2 for statistical testing and reporting in 2025. 

Due to the burden of testing and reporting for the programs impacted heavily by disaster supplemental appropriation disbursements, DHS is generally reporting statistical testing results two years in arrears. While supporting the mission, DHS remains strongly committed to ensuring our agency’s transparency and accountability to the American taxpayer and achieving the most cost-effective strategy on the reduction of improper payments. For specifics regarding changes in reporting for specific programs as well as program results, please refer to the program level reporting. In comparison to prior year reporting, DHS has: 

a)	Removed one program from PIIA Phase 2 reporting as the program has been adequately baselined under PIIA requirements and has been determined to not be susceptible to significant improper payments and thus reverted to PIIA Phase 1, effective for the 2024 reporting period.
•	FEMA Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) – Disaster Supplemental Funds 

b)	Continued PIIA Phase 2 reporting for one program, based on FY 2022 disbursement activity, effective for the 2024 reporting period.
•	U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Procurement, Construction, and Improvements (PC&I) – Disaster Supplemental Funds

c)	Added one program into PIIA Phase 2 reporting based on FY 2022 disbursement activity, effective for the 2024 reporting period.
•	FEMA Funeral Assistance 

d)	Initiated catch-up PIIA Phase 2 reporting for one program, to cover FY 2021 and FY 2022 disbursement activity, effective for the 2024 reporting period. 
•	FEMA Public Assistance – Validate as You Go (VAYGo) 

e)	Determined one program has met the criteria per the agency’s risk assessment process to be deemed susceptible to significant improper payments and thus will be moved to Phase 2 for the 2025 reporting period.
•	Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) PC&I – Disaster Supplemental Funds

For the 2024 reporting of Phase 2 programs, DHS is publishing an improper payment estimates for a total of three programs. All program disbursement activity subject to assessment and reporting in 2024 included outlay activity from FY 2022 but due to the delay in FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo reporting in the prior year, that program is publishing 24-month assessment coverage and error reporting to also include coverage for disbursements made in FY 2021. Overall, DHS conducted assessments over more than $41.4 billion in disbursement activity with over 96 percent of disbursements being deemed proper. As such, DHS is reporting an agency-wide error rate of approximately 3.84 percent in 2024. As highlighted in the program specific reporting, the FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo program accounts for just under 96 percent of the disbursement amount that was reviewed by the agency and contributed to just over 96 percent of the DHS total IP and UP reported totals. The primary root causes for errors identified during the 2024 assessment and reporting period were:
•	Unable to Determine whether the Payment is Proper or Improper due to Insufficient Documentation (categorized as Unknown Payments) – estimated error amount of just under $1.4 billion accounting for over 87 percent of the total DHS reported error rate
•	Failure to Access Data or Information (categorized as Improper Payments) – estimated error amount of just under $195.3 million accounting for over 12 percent of the total DHS reported error rate 

To address the issues surrounding insufficient documentation, FEMA continues to work with recipients and applicants on obtaining additional information and missing documentation for the UPs. FEMA remains committed to streamlining and automating the program processes, training relevant parties and stakeholders, ensuring that policy and process documentation is current and available, and maintaining consistent and regular oversight through internal reviews and audit activity while not overburdening grant recipients and assistance applicants. With the two major programs contributing solely to the 2024 estimated error rates for the agency, please refer to the program level reporting for the FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo program and the FEMA Funeral Assistance program for additional detail regarding granular root causes, corrective actions taken, corrective actions planned, and for additional context related to the payment environment and integrity of the program. 

Finally, in 2024 the DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) completed its evaluation to determine the Department’s compliance with PIIA requirements based off of the FY 2023 reporting. The DHS OIG determined that DHS complied with 9 out of 10 PIIA requirements and did not have any programs reporting above the statutory threshold. The OIG noted a non-compliance related to the requirement to publish IP and UP estimates for programs susceptible to significant improper payments. Specifically, DHS did not comply with the requirement to publish IP and UP estimates for the FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo program in FY 2023 due to the delay in PIIA reporting, highlighted above. 

The DHS OIG made two recommendations to improve DHS's compliance with the PIIA related to 1) ensuring the testing and reporting of improper payments and unknown payments of the FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo program and 2) ensuring that DHS follows the OMB reporting requirements for programs determined to be noncompliant with PIIA as stated in Appendix C of OMB Circular No. A-123. DHS concurred with both recommendations and at the time of the OIG compliance report publication, the recommendations were considered open and resolved. Overall, DHS, at a summary level, is taking the following actions to resolve the OIG recommendations: 
•	DHS will complete the PIIA Phase 2 assessment over the FY 2021 disbursements made by the FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo program and publish an error estimate as part of the Department’s FY 2024 reporting.
•	DHS will follow the OMB requirements for a first-year noncompliant program, to include describing the actions that FEMA will take to achieve compliance for the FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo program as part of the OMB annual data call for publication on PaymentAccuracy.gov. 

Based on the timeline for actions to come into compliance, the majority of the associated activities are expected to be fully completed in the FY 2024 PIIA reporting cycle.","2024"

(Unit- Free-Text)","Across the Department, many DHS Components utilize the Do Not Pay (DNP) Initiative to assist in preventing and detecting improper payments. Primary use is focused during the “At the Time of Payment” stage in the payment lifecycle. Any funds disbursed by the Department of Treasury go through Payment Integration, in which the DNP Portal automatically matches all payment files against the established DNP datasets. Current DHS usage of the DNP Initiative is more heavily focused on detecting potential payment issues versus prevention. 

Based on the DHS usage of DNP in fiscal year (FY) 2024, there were 12 DHS Components had their payment data reviewed against the DNP datasets which have been vetted against Social Security Administration (SSA) Death Master File (DMF), American InfoSource (AIS) Obituary and Probate, Department of Defense, and Department of State data sources during Payment Integration (or at the time of payment). Overall, in FY 2024 (note that due to the timing of this reporting, all September 2024 activity may not yet have been included on the Payment Activity Report) there were approximately 3.8 million DHS payments reviewed totaling to over $45.6 billion in disbursement activity. For the data reported:
•	Approximately 89 percent of DHS payments had no issues noted during the review.
•	Approximately 10 percent of DHS payments were noted as having incomplete or invalid data elements (i.e., social security number, first / last name, etc.) that resulted in the payment transaction being deemed as ‘unmatchable’ to the standardized DNP datasets.
•	Less than 1 percent of payments were “matched” to the standardized DNP datasets and thus required further DHS review and adjudication to determine the appropriateness of the payment.","2024"

Retirement & Annuitant Pay (issued by DFAS) is currently in the process of enrolling into DNP with the anticipated implementation in fiscal year 2024. Amongst the three DoD agencies currently enrolled in DNP, the Department uses the online search, payment integration, and batch matching features of DNP on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. The majority of the flagged payees are based on the Death Master File and the name match results from the rest of the DNP databases (e.g., System for Award Management). The Department researches all payments that are identified to be potentially improper.

Research has determined that the majority of these match results are false positives (e.g., a vendor’s tax identification number is matched to a deceased individual’s social security number, and the payment is erroneously flagged). The remaining matches are almost always deemed proper based on established business rules related to contracts terms and vendor performance (as payments cannot be stopped to vendors who performed properly under contractual agreements).

Where the system identifies exclusion matches for supplier records of POs with funding exhausted, DOE closes such records. A note is then added in the DBA name field that the vendor has an active exclusion. A request to reopen the supplier would alert the supplier team to perform mandatory validation checks before reopening. This ensures no new awards are granted to suppliers with active exclusions. DOE also send a daily file to DNP for Batch Matching to ensure that there are no missed data source matches in the Continuous Monitoring process that would result from any timing issues.

DOE utilizes DNP as a proactive solution for reducing/preventing improper payments as opposed to being reactive. During FY 2023, there were 3 supplier records closed due to active SAM Exclusion matches in DNP. Closing of supplier records prevents procurement offices from entering into any new contracts with the vendors which could result in improper payments. Since DNP is a proactive solution to preventing improper payments, quantitative amount of the dollar or number of improper payments prevented by the use of DNP cannot be made; otherwise, the cost of tracking would outweigh the benefit.

DOE utilizes other databases besides the SAM Exclusion, such as:
-	American InfoSource Death Data – Obituary (AIS-OBIT)
-	Dept of Defense Death Data (DOD)
-	SAM Entity Registration Records (SAMENT)
-	TOP Debt Check (DBCK)

(Unit - Free-Text) ","The DoD Office of Inspector General (OIG) evaluated the compliance of the DoD’s 16 programs with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA). The audit for fiscal year (FY) 2023 revealed that eight Phase 1 programs successfully met the PIIA requirements. It also found that the eight Phase 2 programs were compliant with only five out of the six PIIA requirements.  On the sixth requirement, the DoD IG found the Department lacked an adequate methodology to ascertain the completeness of the DoD’s universe of transactions. Consequently, the Department was unable to publish reliable estimates.

To address this, the Department is adopting two strategic paths to achieve PIIA compliance, incorporating the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-123, Appendix C, Phase 1 (Risk Assessments) and Phase 2 (Sampling & Estimation) approaches. These phases are not necessarily sequential or obligatory. A program can achieve and maintain PIIA compliance in either phase. This is accomplished by implementing corrective actions aimed at reducing both improper payments and unknown payments. The goal is to bring these payment rates below the PIIA statutory threshold or to a tolerable level.

Path 1: Risk Assessments for PIIA Compliance (Phase 1)

This path involves conducting comprehensive risk assessments on unique data characteristics and subpopulation groups. These groups are not expected to be susceptible to significant improper and unknown payments due to their internal controls designed to mitigate risk. In FY 2024, we restructured the department’s entire Payment Integrity portfolio based on the results and recommendations from the DoD OIG’s previous audits and interagency lessons learned.

Path 2: Sampling & Estimation for PIIA Compliance (Phase 2)

This path targets programs anticipated to exceed the OMB statutory threshold and likely to have significant improper and unknown payments. In FY 2023, the DoD OIG found that the Department produced unreliable improper payment and unknown payment estimates for the 13th consecutive year. Despite having statistically valid sampling plans, the Phase 2 programs failed due to the unsubstantiated payment population used to create the test samples.

To rectify these deficiencies, the Department will establish a Payment Integrity Universe of Transactions (UoT) working group. This group aims to report reliable estimates by the FY 2025 reporting cycle, which will include a complete and reconciled payment population along with the previous valid sampling methodology. The working group’s goal is to develop and implement a standardized process to identify each program’s UoT population data characteristics, validate the completeness of the UoT payment population, and produce reliable improper and unknown payment estimates.

Appendix C requires agencies to review all programs and activities for the risk of improper payment by performing assessments to determine whether those programs are “susceptible to significant improper payments.” In accordance with PIIA, DOI conducts comprehensive risk assessments on a three-year cycle of all agency programs with payments greater than $10 million during the assessment period (In Cycle Risk Assessment). With OMB concurrence, DOI utilizes an alternative annual assessment period from quarter 4 of the prior fiscal year through quarter 3 of the current fiscal year. 

In FY 2023, DOI performed an Out-of-Cycle risk assessment of fourteen (14) programs, including new programs and those with significant changes (e.g. legislation, changes in funding levels, etc.), totaling approximately $2.1 billion in payments for the assessment period of Quarter 4 of FY 2022 through Quarter 3 of FY 2023 (assessment period). This year (FY 2024), the OIG performed an inspection of the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Compliance with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 in Its Fiscal Year 2023 Agency Financial Report and determined that the Department complied with PIIA for FY 2023. However, noted that the risk assessment conducted for one of the 14 programs assessed in FY 2023 did not accurately evaluate qualitative factors. While this issue did not affect the Department’s overall compliance the OIG cautioned that inaccurately completing risk assessments could lead to an incorrect assessment of risk of improper payments in the future. As a result, the OIG made one (1) recommendation in FY 2024 for the Department to establish and implement a uniform training program for all improper payment risk assessors that provides comprehensive guidance on appropriate assessment of all required risk factors. 

During FY 2024, the Department implemented corrective actions in response to the FY 2024 recommendation issued by the OIG. This involved developing and conducting an Improper Payment Integrity Training Program for all personnel involved in conducting, reviewing, and/or approving improper payment risk assessments. The Department will continue to require this training annually to develop accurate and effective risk assessments and identify programs who are susceptible to being at high risk for improper payments. 


In FY 2025, the Department will conduct an In-Cycle risk assessment, requiring all DOI programs with annual outlays greater than $10 million to undergo a risk evaluation. If any DOI programs are found to be susceptible to significant improper payments during that assessment, they will proceed to Phase 2 testing in FY 2026, as mandated by PIIA.

In FY 2024, the Department identified a rise in overpayments through internal control reviews, surpassing the amounts reported in FY 2023. Consequently, the Department recovered greater sums, reflecting the larger overpayments discovered during the year.","2024"

Most of these groups are not expected to be susceptible to significant improper and unknown payments due to the strength of their internal controls which mitigate risk.  Programs deemed susceptible to significant improper and unknown payments must transition to Phase 2.

Actions were initiated in FY 2022 and built upon in FY 2023 through the successful restructuring of the Defense Health Agency Military Health Benefits portfolio.  The restructuring involved dividing the large Military Health Benefits program into six smaller, more manageable programs.  This strategic division allowed the Department to concentrate on the unique risks and controls associated with each program.  As a result of the restructure and targeted focus on program-specific risk factors and mitigating controls, the Department achieved PIIA compliance for the first time in the Military Health Benefits portfolio.  The Department then examined all programs to understand the correlation between individual subgroup error rates and their combined program error rates.  The Department found that robust internal control processes directly contributed to the individual program’s lower projected improper and unknown payment rates.  The Department-wide efforts in FY 2024 were focused on performing comprehensive risk assessments to document, identify, and classify the inherent risks and mitigating factors of payment types. As such, the Department leveraged this reorganization (16 total programs in FY 2023; 8 Phase 1 and 8 Phase 2 to 42 Phase 1 and 6 Phase 2 programs in FY 2024) to develop and implement appropriate internal controls to reduce improper and unknown payments and uphold financial stewardship of taxpayer money. This strategy aligns with the OMB’s Joint Financial Management Improvement Program and demonstrates that PIIA compliance is achievable through the Department’s current internal control environment.

"DOD","exs1","[exs1] Provide an executive summary of the payment integrity activities and results for the agency for this reporting period (SEE - 'Helpful Hint' - minimum length requirements vary depending on Agency status). (Unit - Free-Text)","The Department of Defense (DoD or the Department) met the overarching intent of the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-123, Appendix C.  Payment Integrity has been a top management priority, with the development of effective methodologies to identify, prevent, and recover improper payments. 

In the fiscal year (FY) 2023 PIIA compliance audit, the Department successfully met five out of six compliance criteria.  To achieve full PIIA compliance, the Department has adopted two strategic paths, incorporating the OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C, Phase 1 (Risk Assessments) and Phase 2 (Sampling & Estimation) approaches. 

In FY 2024, the Department restructured its entire Payment Integrity portfolio, integrating the results and recommendations from the DoD Office of Inspector General’s (OIG) previous audit findings and interagency lessons learned.  The aim was to bring improper payment (IP) and unknown payment (UP) rates below the PIIA statutory threshold.  The Department established these Payment Integrity programs to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of Payment Integrity reporting while streamlining Department resources and striving towards achieving compliance with the PIIA and OMB guidance. 

The Department’s current payment integrity portfolio consists of 48 separate programs, including 42 Phase 1 programs and six Phase 2 programs.  In FY 2023, three Phase 1 programs completed their risk assessments and achieved PIIA compliance, moving them to a three-year cycle.  In FY 2024, 20 programs completed improper payment risk assessments and determined that they were not likely to be susceptible to significant improper and unknown payments.  The Department aims to complete risk assessments for the remaining 19 programs in FY 2025.  By identifying low-risk programs and placing them in Phase 1 reporting, the Department can allocate resources more efficiently and focus on high-risk Phase 2 programs. 

In FY 2024, the Department’s six Phase 2 programs identified $256.0 billion in payments or outlays subject to testing under the PIIA and estimated a proper payment rate of 99.58 percent ($255.9 billion).  The IP rate was approximately 0.25 percent ($635.3 million), and the UP rate was approximately 0.17 percent ($451.4 million).  The Department employed a statistical methodology recommended by the DoD OIG to develop these FY 2024 IP and UP results, which tested more high-risk payment samples.  The overarching goal is to achieve PIIA compliance, specifically compliance criteria #3, by publishing IP and UP estimates for programs susceptible to significant IPs and UPs in the accompanying materials to the annual financial statement.  

The Department prevented all the Phase 2 programs from becoming a high priority program in FY 2024 through its continued efforts to identify error root causes, focus on controls that detect and prevent overpayments, implement or reinforce applicable processes and procedures, and train staff on policy guidance and best practices.

The Department has dedicated considerable effort to identifying and recovering $1,827.4 million in monetary losses, successfully recovering $1,684.0 million through its Payment Recovery Audits and Activities program.  This achievement underscores the Department’s commitment to proper stewardship of funding and demonstrates the effectiveness of its recovery initiatives.

(Unit- Free-Text)","The overarching intent of the DoD Office of Inspector General (OIG) Payment Integrity recommendations is geared towards particular actions to bring the programs in alignment with achieving compliance with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA), specifically with requirement #3, the reliability of the estimates, instead of specific recommendations to prevent and or to reduce improper and/or unknown payments. In the FY 2023 DoD OIG PIIA Compliance audit it was stated that while the DoD complied with five of the six PIIA requirements, it did not comply with the requirement to publish reliable improper payment estimates. This was due to DoD personnel not having a sufficient methodology for determining the completeness of the DoD’s universe of payment transactions (UoTs) used to produce its improper and unknown payment estimates. The DoD OIG has issued recommendations for the statistical formula used to calculate the sample size for improper and unknown payment projections, sample population Universe of Transactions, reconciliation to the disbursement systems, payment type exclusions, and internal controls surrounding the current processes. Since the publication of the FY 2023 PIIA Compliance audit report, the Department has taken specific and deliberate steps to implement numerous DoD OIG recommendations to bring the programs in alignment with the PIIA compliance requirements. These steps include creating working groups and additional Senior Executive level meetings to determine the most advantageous route forward in developing UoT’s and substantiating the slight variances between the entitlement and disbursement systems. These ongoing efforts are geared towards achieving PIIA compliance with the last remaining requirement. 

Background: In FY 2023, all eight of the DoD’s Phase 2 programs were found non-compliant with PIIA Requirement #3: Published IP and UP estimates for programs susceptible to significant IPs and UPs in the accompanying materials to the annual financial statement. As stated in the Agency Executive Summary: In FY 2024, the Department restructured its entire Payment Integrity portfolio, integrating the results and recommendations from the DoD OIG’s previous audit findings and interagency lessons learned.

As a result of this restructuring, the following eight FY 2023 non-compliant programs no longer exist in FY 2024:

•	Civilian Pay
•	Commercial Pay
•	DoD Travel Pay
•	Military Pay – Army
•	Military Pay – Navy

(Unit- Free-Text)","With oversight from the Employment and Training Administration (ETA), each state Unemployment Insurance (UI) agency is responsible for promoting and maintaining UI program integrity through prevention, detection, investigation, establishment, and recovery of improper payments. States identify and establish overpayments for recovery using methods such as crossmatching with the State Directory of New Hires, the National Directory of New Hires, the UI Integrity Center’s Integrity Data Hub, quarterly wage records submitted by employers, matches with databases such as Workers Compensation, incarceration records, and other sources such as tips and leads.

State UI laws provide for overpayment recovery and states are required to follow their individual state laws and policies in executing recovery efforts. ETA requires states to report quarterly on overpayment detection and recovery activities, including information on actual amounts of UI overpayments established and recovered.

States are required to hold claimants liable to repay improperly received benefits and take an active role to
 
recover improper payments. Overpayment recovery is critical to protect both state UI trust funds and federal funds and ETA has reminded states that overpayment recovery must be given the same priority as fraud prevention and detection activities. States may waive recovery of non-fraud overpayments when it would be against equity and good conscience pursuant to their state’s law. States may also waive recovery of certain non-fraud overpayments under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, as amended, in accordance with federal guidance (see Unemployment Insurance Program Letter (UIPL) No. 20-21 and 20-21, Change 1). Under no circumstances may a state waive recovery activities for a fraudulent overpayment.

ETA issued UIPL No. 11-23 reminding states of required and recommended program integrity functions, which includes overpayment recovery activities, for the unemployment compensation (UC) programs. ETA requires states to use the overpayment recovery tools listed below (with citations providing ETA with authority to require such actions):
•	Benefit Offsets (Title II, Subtitle A of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, UIPL No. 05-13, and Section 5 of UIPL No. 13- 20, Change 2);
•	Treasury Offset Program (TOP) for applicable covered debt (Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, UIPL No. 02-19, 12-14, and 04-20);
•	Cross Program Offset Recovery Agreement (CPORA) (UIPL No. 05-13); and
•	Interstate Reciprocal Offset Recovery Arrangement (IPORA) (UIPL No. 05-13).

ETA also strongly recommends states use the following additional overpayment recovery activities, where allowed by state law, as part of an effective overpayment recovery operation:
•	Negotiating repayment plans;
•	Accepting repayments through various methods (e.g. online, via debit/credit card);
•	State Income Tax Offset Program;
•	Wage garnishments;
•	Property liens and assessments;
•	Offsets of lottery winnings, homestead exemptions, and other benefits;
•	Active participation in probate and/or bankruptcy proceedings regarding an individual with an outstanding overpayment;
•	Skip tracing;
•	Work proactively and collaboratively with banks and financial institutions to detect suspicious activity, ensure that accounts are not unduly suspended, and recover overpayments (UIPL No. 19-21);
•	Civil actions;
•	Credit bureau referrals;
•	State/federal prosecution;
•	Penalties and interest on overpayments in compliance with state and federal law;
•	Collection agency referrals when state staff is limited, or debt is uncollectable by other means;
•	Implementing a voluntary fraud self-disclosure program; and
•	Other recovery methods as determined by state law or policy.

However, in cases involving UI identity fraud, when the perpetrator of fraud is unknown, a state may also identify the overpayment as “uncollectible”, as recovery efforts could not be initiated until the perpetrator of fraud is identified. If the perpetrator of fraud is not identified and the state’s law authorizes overpayments to be written off, the state is permitted to write-off the overpayment in accordance with their state law.

"ED","exs1","[exs1] Provide an executive summary of the payment integrity activities and results for the agency for this reporting period (SEE - 'Helpful Hint' - minimum length requirements vary depending on Agency status). (Unit - Free-Text)","Federal Student Aid's (FSA’s) Federal Pell Grant (Pell) and William D. Ford Direct Loan (Direct Loan) programs are considered Phase 2 programs per OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C (“A-123C”). The major causes of improper payments (IP) and unknown payments (UP) in FY 2024 are related to misreported income, credit balance deficiencies, incorrect financial aid determination, and student withdrawal deficiencies. These root causes are consistent with those identified for prior year IP and UP estimates. FSA has developed corrective action plans to mitigate and prevent IPs and UPs that are within FSA’s control. For example, through the Student Aid and Borrower Eligibility (SABER) Initiative, FSA has implemented the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act and Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) Simplification Act for the 2024-2025 FAFSA which streamlines and strengthens the collection of data used to determine eligibility for student financial assistance. IPs and UPs that are outside of FSA’s control are mainly attributed to challenges at institutions that are responsible for disbursing Pell and Direct Loan funds. FSA will continue to provide training to institutions through various avenues, such as the FSA Annual Conference, and perform various oversight activities to ensure institutions meet FSA requirements for institutional eligibility, financial responsibility, and administrative capability.  

The FY 2024 IP and UP rate for the Pell program is 2.64% down from 2.83% in FY 2023. The decrease in the FY 2024 Pell estimate from the FY 2023 is primarily due to a decrease in IPs as derived from compliance audit data. The FY2024 IP and UP rate for the Direct Loan program is 0.94%, up from 0.70% in FY 2023.  The increase in the FY 2024 Direct Loan estimate from FY 2023 is primarily due to an increase in IPs as derived from compliance audit data.  

The Department also estimated the FY 2024 IP and UP rates for one non-FSA Phase 2 program: Education Stabilization Fund (ESF). The FY 2024 IP and UP rate for the ESF program is 0.00015%. The ESF program experienced overpayments that were beyond the agency’s control, due to automatic rounding errors. These discrepancies occurred both within Excel and other system-based processes. Preventing rounding within system-based processes is inherently challenging. When rounding occurs in a system and is subsequently recalculated in Excel, discrepancies can arise, resulting in minor differences in amounts. Consequently, it is difficult for states to prevent these rounding errors, which is why they are classified as beyond the agency’s control.  

In FY 2023, the Department implemented measures to reduce unknown payments, the predominant reason for the Title I, Part A, Grants to Local Educational Agencies program’s high improper payment estimate reported in FY22. The Department worked with state educational agencies (SEAs) to produce sufficient documentation for any advanced payments. Additionally, there were no unknown payments reported for FY23 for the Special Education Grants to States program. With the Department’s OIG’s determination of FY23 compliance with the Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA), both of these programs moved from Phase 2 (estimation) to Phase 1 (risk assessment).  

The Department continues its efforts to collect confirmed IPs. Although the Department has determined that payment recapture audits would not be cost effective for any of its programs and activities, the Department identifies and recovers IPs through other recovery mechanisms. The Department works with grantees and Title IV (FSA) program participants to resolve and recover amounts identified in compliance audits, OIG audits, and program reviews. Additionally, the Department analyzes the return of grant funds from recipients to determine if they are due to IPs. When an IP is confirmed and deemed collectable, the Department establishes an account receivable and pursues collection. Additionally, the Department has wide discretion to decide not to collect IPs from grantees in cases where it determines that pursuing collections would cause more harm to the federal interest. 

Finally, by performing improper payment risk assessments, the Department has not identified any new programs as high risk requiring an estimate. The Department continues to maintain PIIA compliance by emphasizing prevention of improper payments. Excessive drawdowns can reveal grantee cash management issues, an area where the Department’s grants management community continues to address through its technical assistance to grantees.","2024"

The frequency and complexity of fraud attacks, specifically identity (ID) fraud, against state unemployment programs increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. State UI systems were, and continue to be, targeted by sophisticated and organized fraud, perpetrated by domestic and international criminal organizations seeking to exploit the UI program for financial gain. A combination of decades of underfunding, outdated state UI information technology (IT) systems, record claims volumes, and weaker integrity controls in 2020, provided an opportunity for criminals to expose vulnerabilities in state UI systems, which resulted in elevated rates of improper payments. States have and continue to work tirelessly to combat relentless fraud attacks, but the fraud schemes rapidly evolve to circumvent prevention and detection tools and strategies implemented by states. ETA continues to issue reminders to states about the critical importance of using a multi-layered approach to identify and prevent fraud and reduce improper payments.  ETA and state UI agencies work collaboratively with the Department’s Office of Inspector General (DOL-OIG) and refer cases of UI fraud, waste, abuse, mismanagement, and misconduct to DOL-OIG for investigation and prosecution.

The Department places a heightened priority on program integrity and mitigating UI fraud risks. ETA remains fully committed to reducing IPs and combatting fraud in the UI programs.  In FY 2024, the Department completely aligned existing UI fraud risk management activities with the leading practices provided in the Government Accountability Office’s (GAO) Fraud Risk Framework.  Through the development of a UI Fraud Risk Profile, the Department further strengthened an organizational culture that views the creation, evaluation, monitoring, and evolution of risk mitigation strategies as an ongoing process. ETA develops, updates, oversees, and communicates UI antifraud strategies through an ever-evolving, robust and dynamic UI Integrity Strategic Plan, that includes innovative strategies and antifraud controls to combat emerging fraud schemes and address the highest residual risk identified in the UI Fraud Risk Profile. ETA’s efforts to improve program integrity in the UC programs include providing guidance, technical assistance, resources, and funding to support states in combatting fraud, strengthening ID verification, reducing IPs, recovering overpayments, assessing and addressing fraud risks, protecting victims of ID fraud, and evaluating data to ensure effectiveness and equity in fraud prevention and detection efforts. The Department continues to explore, research, identify, invest in, and provide states with new tools, resources, strategies, and guidance to help states combat the continually changing and new emerging types of sophisticated fraud impacting the UI system.

As described in the Executive Summary above, FY23 Payment Integrity reporting for PUA was census reporting covering the full life of the weeks of eligibility of the program from its beginning through its expiration in law on September 6, 2021 (though many states terminated the program earlier). Because the program is expired in law and no longer active, no further payment integrity action is possible, nor is it possible to provide an updated improper payment rate under the S&EMP. Consistent with the prior year’s Agency Financial Report  and PaymentAccuracy.gov reporting, DOL Office of Unemployment Insurance (OUI) determined that no further annual payment integrity reporting is possible. The amount of FY24 PUA outlays is $-1,737.83M. DOL would apply the previously estimated 18.53% IP rate, which was developed for the life of the PUA program, to any PUA outlays – however this is not applicable to negative outlays.

"DOT","exs1","[exs1] Provide an executive summary of the payment integrity activities and results for the agency for this reporting period (SEE - 'Helpful Hint' - minimum length requirements vary depending on Agency status). (Unit - Free-Text)","The Department of Transportation (DOT) prioritizes payment integrity efforts and recognizes the importance of maintaining effective internal controls to ensure proper payments. Safeguarding DOT’s assets and resources reinforces the Department’s mission: To deliver the world’s leading transportation system, serving the American people and economy through the safe, efficient, sustainable, and equitable movement of people and goods. 

DOT is proud to report a Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 payment accuracy rate of 98.10% that compares favorably to the most recent Federal-wide payment accuracy rate of 94.58% reported in FY 2023. The FY 2024 payment accuracy rate was below our reduction target and decreased slightly when compared to the prior year rate of 99.3%. Our reduction target aligns with the Organizational Excellence strategic objective within the Department's FY 2022-2026 Strategic Plan to ensure responsible and transparent stewardship of public resources. The plan includes an aggressive performance goal to achieve a 99% payment accuracy rate to demonstrate robust internal controls at both the Federal and grant recipient levels. 

For FY 2024 phase 2 programs, the Federal Highway Administration’s Highway Planning and Construction achieved a payment accuracy rate of 98.04% and the Federal Transit Administration’s Transit Infrastructure Grant – Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID) Relief Funds achieved a rate of 98.44%. Both payment accuracy rates are below our 99% performance goal; yet remain within the upper and lower bounds of their historical estimates. Therefore, we view the rates for both programs to be within their historical statistical ranges and will closely monitor them against FY 2025 results to determine if any changes represent a trend that require more aggressive corrective action. 

Common characteristics of DOT’s programs susceptible to significant improper payments (IPs) are that both programs are administered by grant recipients, typically a State DOT or local transit authority, and that IPs are outside of our control when the grant recipients make administrative errors. Whereas grant recipients are responsible for the administration of federal assistance, DOT is responsible, primarily through its division and regional offices, for ensuring compliance with Federal requirements and proper use of Federal funds. The IP sampling and estimation process is an example of one method DOT utilizes to assess grant recipient compliance with Federal requirements and to identify emerging causes of payment integrity risk. During FY 2024, DOT’s Inspector General (OIG) concluded that our FY 2023 reports were compliant with Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) requirements as prescribed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The OIG will issue a report in FY 2025 with a determination on whether DOT’s FY 2024 reports were compliant with PIIA requirements.  

Training and maintaining strong partnerships with our grant recipients are essential to reducing DOT’s IPs over time. DOT Operating Administrations work with grant recipients to: improve project documentation, contractual adherence, adherence of Federal regulation requirements, invoice verification, payment processes, and address training deficiencies as applicable for each IP. While robust, the internal control systems and structures of our grant recipients across the Nation must constantly evolve to meet changing Federal statutory and regulatory requirements. For example, the statutory COVID relief funding requirements established a date, January 20, 2020, for cost eligibility. While well defined, the date is quite arbitrary when applied to a grant recipient financial management systems that process retroactive pay adjustments or bundle newly eligible costs for reimbursement from a wide range of dates. Hence, continued collaboration and communication between DOT and our State and Local partners is a necessity to ensure compliance with Federal requirements including the accuracy of payment requests.

DOT’s Payment Integrity Center is responsible for coordinating improper payment reviews, reporting results, and monitoring the progress of corrective actions in accordance with PIIA, OMB Circular No. A-123 Appendix C, Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement, and OMB Circular No. A-136, Financial Reporting Requirements. The Integrity Center’s trend analysis of overall disbursements by Treasury code and monitoring of DOT spending reports identifies and validates new, as well as significant payment changes to existing programs. Annually, the Integrity Center performs a Department-wide payment analysis based on monthly Treasury statements (MTS). The Integrity Center also monitors spending reports available to the public on DOT’s webpage. Two publicly available reports include the: USDOT COVID-19 Relief Funding and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) Funding Status report. 

In addition to monitoring program spending and estimating IPs for 2 programs, the Department: performed an IP risk assessment, conducted a payment recovery audit, monitored the progress of corrective actions, analyzed confirmed fraud cases, and screened payments against the Do Not Pay databases. DOT phase 1 programs must perform an IP risk assessment at a minimum once every three years unless there is a program or funding change. Most of DOT’s programs completed triennial risk assessment cycle during FY 2023 with 1 program assessed in FY 2024 as not susceptible to significant improper payments. For FY 2025, the DOT Payment Integrity Center plans perform annual requirements, monitor implementation of corrective actions developed in FY 2024, and report IP estimates for its 2 programs that continue to be susceptible to significant improper payments. We take pride in our payment integrity efforts and remain committed to strengthening our payment processing controls going forward.","2024"

The EPA’s payments are screened by the Treasury’s DNP working system to detect improper payments. The Treasury analyzes each agency’s payments and provides a monthly report itemizing any payments that were made to potentially ineligible recipients. These potential matches are identified when the name of an agency’s payee matches the name of an individual or entity listed in federal data sources contained in the Treasury’s DNP working system.
In FY 2024, the Treasury screened the EPA payments through the following DNP data sources on a post-payment basis: the Social Security Administration’s Death Master File and the General Services Administration’s System for Award Management Exclusion List. During FY 2024 a total of 226,737 EPA  payments worth $6.51 billion were screened. Of those payments, only one was identified as potentially improper.

"DOL","exs1","[exs1] Provide an executive summary of the payment integrity activities and results for the agency for this reporting period (SEE - 'Helpful Hint' - minimum length requirements vary depending on Agency status). (Unit - Free-Text)","In FY23, the Department of Labor’s (DOL), Office of Inspector General (DOL-OIG) found the Department’s Federal-State Unemployment Insurance (UI) program ""non-compliant"" with certain criteria in PIIA. DOL’s response to DOL-OIG's findings are detailed in Management's Response to the OIG's draft report.

In FY24 DOL found two programs to be ""susceptible to significant improper payments (IP)"". These are 1) the Employment and Training Administration - Federal State UI program, and 2) the Office of Workers' Compensation - Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) program. 

DOL Overview
DOL conducts a program inventory annually and conducts risk assessments of all identified programs on a minimum triennial basis as required by M-21-19. In FY24, DOL identified one new program, Bureau of Labor Statistics - Headquarters Relocation meeting the $10,000,000 threshold for risk assessment and public reporting in FY24, nor were any programs newly determined to be ""susceptible to significant IP"". DOL’s FY24 Program Inventory also identified another program, Employment & Training Administration - Community Projects, which exceeded the $10M outlays threshold in PIIA for the first time per FY24 reporting. Per M-21-19 requirements a program must exist for a full year before risk assessment and reporting is required. However, a preliminary risk assessment found it to be not susceptible. Further Risk Assessment and reporting is anticipated for FY25 if outlays continue to meet legal thresholds.  

Unemployment Insurance (UI) programs: 
DOL bases the Federal-State UI improper payment estimates on results of the Benefit Accuracy Measurement (BAM) survey, which examines a nationwide statistically valid sample of payments made in the three largest permanently authorized unemployment compensation programs: State UI program, Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE), and Unemployment Compensation for Ex-service members (UCX). The BAM sample does not include payments made under episodic programs such as Extended Benefits (EB) and temporary programs like the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program and the UI-related programs created by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020, including Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA), Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC), Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC), and Mixed-Earners Unemployment Compensation (MEUC) programs. As a result, the $35,196.6M in reported outlays for 2024 include $34,949.69M in outlays from the regular Federal-State UI program and $246.92M in outlays from the UCFE and UCX programs.

The period of benefits coverage for all pandemic-related UI programs, including PUA, PEUC, FPUC, and MEUC, expired in law on September 6, 2021, though some states stopped offering these benefits prior to that date. States continued to work backlogs, adjudicate and pay benefits, resolve appeals, and determine and collect overpaid benefits under these temporary programs in the current reporting period. Several pandemic-related UI programs report negative outlays, which is due to states’ ongoing overpayment recovery efforts. Since the total outlays for each of the pandemic-related programs were less than $10,000,000, no specific data is reported for these programs on PaymentAccuracy.gov. These negative outlays were not used to artificially reduce normal UI program reported outlays nor impact IP estimates. However, for transparency purposes, DOL is reporting the program outlays for the pandemic-related UI programs and other temporary and episodic UI programs here:
EB = $12.06M
EUC = $0.14M
FPUC = $-1,852.87M
MEUC = $0.43M
PEUC = $-269.75M
PUA = $-1,737.83M

The PUA program was determined ""susceptible"" in FY21. DOL submitted a Sampling and Estimation Methodology Plan (S&EMP) for estimating the PUA program’s improper payment rate and amount to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on June 30, 2022. In October 2022, OMB requested that DOL conduct further analysis of the outcomes recorded through the PUA case review process. OMB and DOL agreed to collaborate in conducting this additional analysis. In direct collaboration with OMB, the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) updated the PUA S&EMP. OMB accepted the update and DOL published information on the methodology and the IP estimation on August 21, 2023.

FY23 Payment Integrity reporting for PUA was census reporting covering the full life of the weeks of eligibility of the program from its beginning through its expiration in law on September 6, 2021 (though many states terminated the program earlier). Because the program is expired in law and no longer active, no further payment integrity action is possible, nor is it possible to provide an updated improper payment rate under the S&EMP. Consistent with the prior year’s Agency Financial Report and PaymentAccuracy.gov reporting, DOL Office of Unemployment Insurance (OUI) determined that no further annual payment integrity PaymentAccuracy.gov reporting is possible. In its PIIA compliance report, DOL-OIG recommended reporting PUA regardless.  However, if DOL were to do so, it would result in reporting consisting almost entirely of “NA” responses since the program has expired. To address DOL-OIG’s concern and to be transparent in sharing information, DOL is providing the outlays for FY2024 in the PUA program. As noted above, the amount of the PUA outlays is $-1,737.83M. DOL would apply the previously estimated 18.53% IP rate, which was developed for the life of the PUA program, to any PUA outlays – however this is not applicable to negative outlays. DOL notified OMB of the decision to reclassify FPUC, PEUC, and PUA as Phase 0 and is not expected to provide further reporting under M-21-19.","2024"

Also, EXIM does not disburse funds directly to payees but through the U.S. Department of Treasury Secured Payment System, where any funds disbursed by the Department of Treasury go through payment integration in which the Do Not Pay portal automatically matches all the files against the Death Master file and the System for Award Management (SAM) exclusion records.","2024"

"EPA","exs1","[exs1] Provide an executive summary of the payment integrity activities and results for the agency for this reporting period (SEE - 'Helpful Hint' - minimum length requirements vary depending on Agency status). (Unit - Free-Text)","In FY 2024 the EPA was found compliant with the requirements of the Payment Integrity Information Act by the agency's OIG. By the end of this fiscal year, the one program (the Grants Program) identified as potentially susceptible to significant improper payments, was determined to not be susceptible as result of a statistical sample of its payments. 
To sustain the Payment Integrity at the EPA, the agency maintains a proactive process of conducting regular risk assessments of its programs and expecting regular, ongoing payment reviews. For practical purposes, the EPA mostly aligns its programs by payment processes. Using that as a starting point, each year, the agency reviews the funding and outlays’ mechanisms of its programs, as well as each program’s purpose to determine if they are sufficiently similar and appropriately sized for proper assessment. For example, a new program could be split out from its current program area due to increase funding while other programs could be merged when the overlap of their processes and/or significant decreases in their funding become apparent.
All of EPA’s current programs are assessed at least once every three years using a standard, qualitative risk assessment survey tool. Any new program that has been in place for 12 months and has exceeded $10 million in outlays per annum also completes the qualitative risk assessment. The survey tool is based on risk factors outlined in the payment integrity statute plus two other risk factors the agency added for potential concerns specific to the EPA. 
Programs that are determined to be susceptible based on the results of the qualitative risk assessment, must then carry out (quantitative) transacting testing using a statistically valid sample of its payments to determine if there is in fact a significant level of improper payments. If the results of the sample conclude the program is making a significant level of improper payments, it must develop and carry out a corrective action plan to reduce the level of improper payments. This process repeats annually for susceptible programs until the it is no longer making a significant amount of improper payments.
In FY 2024, the EPA completed risk assessments on three of its programs. Two programs, the Clean School Bus – Rebates program and the agency’s Settlements program completed qualitative risk assessments using the survey tool. The results of these risk assessments determined that neither program is likely to be susceptible to significant improper payments. Nonetheless, through this risk assessment process, the CSB – Rebates program identified some challenges to its payment processes, and opted to begin countermeasures to address them prior to the formal completion of the risk assessment process.
The third program, the agency’s Grants program had been identified in the FY 2023 as potentially likely to be susceptible to significant improper payments based the results of the qualitative risk assessment completed that year. In FY 2024, the program completed a review of a (statistically valid) sample of its payments. The results showed it had an improper payment rate of 0.77% which is below the susceptibility threshold of 1.5% of its payments.
In addition to annually reviewing how the EPA breaks out its programs, each program is required to continuously review its payments to determine if there have been any improper payments. For any overpayments identified, the programs pursue recovery of those funds. 
A second and third statistical sample occurred in the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF). In recent years the each SRF has completed a ‘50-state’ judgmental sample of the payment draws as a part of its payments reviews. 
Additionally, in Fiscal Year 2024, due to the significant funding increase from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) together with the statute’s expansion of funding for water systems' related work (such as lead pipe service line replacement and addressing emerging contaminants), although not required, the EPA decided to complete statistical samples for the CWSRF and DWSRF programs that received IIJA funding. Each statistical sample also layered in judgmental samples to further assure that each state would have at least one of each payment type reviewed.
Looking forward to FY 2025, as examples of two proactive measures, rather than merely doing qualitative risk assessments, the EPA will conduct the more rigorous statistical sampling of two new programs (Greenhouse Gas Reduction Funds and Environmental Justice Grant Funds) that have received substantial resources under the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

"FCC","CAP5","[CAP5]Provide 6-10 sentences summarizing the conclusions and recommendation(s) provided by the OIG for each non-compliant criterion AND the actions and measurable milestones the program has planned to bring each program into compliance with each non-compliant criterion. (Unit - Free-Text) ","The FCC had two program that were not compliant for the most recent reporting period.  Those programs were the USF-Lifeline program which is in phase 2 since it does not meet the statutory threshold of 1.5% and $10 million in outlays.  The other program that was not in compliance in the Affordable Connectivity program (ACP) which is currently in phase 1 reporting requirements.  
USF-Lifeline - The Commission did not concur with the non-compliance finding for the Lifeline program. The auditors’ recognized that no further action is required going forward. However, we respectfully disagreed with the reasoning and conclusions that were reached. The auditors based their finding on dated inputs (namely, an initial response that gave a preliminary estimate done by our Administrator of what might be a “potential” overpayment). In addition, the auditors appeared to consistently disregarded subsequent written responses by the agency itself indicating that the Commission had determined that the “potential” overpayment estimate the auditors were relying on was vastly overstated. The consequence of the auditor’s approach was to require the agency to report a substantial amount as improper which the agency had repeatedly determined (as a regulatory matter) was not in fact improper, undermining the accuracy of improper payment reporting.
As the FCC previously explained at length, this matter involved an unusual regulatory wrinkle. The Commission had been considering a pending request from an eligible telecommunications carrier (ETC) for a correction to the appendix to the June 13, 2012 order granting it an ETC designation. The consideration of that request was an exercise of the Commission’s regulatory authority, and a decision on the application had to be made before a determination was made regarding whether any payments were improper. The basic substance of that decision was made in 2020—namely that the particular circumstances justified a nunc pro tunc grant of authorization that would substantially reduce or eliminate any overpayment—and was communicated to the auditors. Ultimately, on May 7, 2024, the agency issued an order granting the request nunc pro tunc to June 13, 2012, the date of the original grant. The effect of the order corrected the clerical filing error made by the ETC and was retroactive to the date the original order and was issued. Moreover, because the order was effective to the date of the original June 2012 order, the ETC provision of service in the relevant areas has giving rise to the audit finding was authorized. Thus there were no improper payments and there was never a need to report such. Per the auditors, on May 7, 2024, the FCC issued two Orders and a related Consent Decree regarding this matter. The Orders and Consent Decree had the effect of retroactively expanding the ETC’s jurisdiction to the full area for which they had been operating. Therefore, the Orders had the effect of retroactively making the balance of payments valid.
ACP - The FCC underreported improper payment amounts of $6 million in its FY23 data that was published on paymentaccuracy.gov. The recommendation by the auditors was to develop and implement policies and procedures to identify, quantify, and report any downward revisions that are submitted by providers resulting from provider non-compliant conduct on paymentaccuracy.gov. Corrective actions will include: 1) Every month, our Administrator will compile and report to the Office of the Managing Director all ACP and EBB downward revisions received the prior month that fall outside of the administrative filing window and 2) Develop an ACP procedure to identify and report downward revisions that are submitted by providers resulting from non-compliant conduct.

(Unit - Free-Text)","Condition 1: The payment of real estate taxes in most leases is designed to be a passthrough from the landlord’s real estate tax bill.  The landlord pays the taxing authority and GSA pays the landlord for its share based on percentage occupancy of the building.  The real estate payment is incorporated into the GSA annual rent payment.  If the actual taxes are more than the amount paid through rent, GSA owes the landlord the difference.  If the actual taxes are less than the amount paid through rent, the landlord owes GSA the difference.  Recoveries arise when Lessor fails to report either of these two scenarios by not sending GSA the appropriate tax bills.    

Resolution 1: GSA has established agencywide procedures to perform annual reviews of all leases when the landlord does not send in taxes.  These procedures have significantly decreased improper payments in this area in the last 4 years.

Condition 2: There are several variables that can cause overpayments at the start up of a lease such as broker commission credits, free rent credits, and credits for holdover payments on a preceding lease, etc.  The overpayments exist if these credits are not entered in the billing system (REXUS) or not properly transferred from the billing system to the payment system (Pegasys).

Resolution 2: Checklists have been developed in GSA's Regions to ensure that all credits are entered into the billing system (REXUS).  Also, in July of 2020, the REXUS to Pegasys interface automatically transfers data from REXUS to Pegasys so that it is no longer a manual process of entering credit data for leases into Pegasys which has helped reduce errors.","2024"

"FCC","exs1","[exs1] Provide an executive summary of the payment integrity activities and results for the agency for this reporting period (SEE - 'Helpful Hint' - minimum length requirements vary depending on Agency status). (Unit - Free-Text)","In accordance with the Improper Payment Information Act (IPIA) of 2002, as amended by the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act (IPERA) of 2010, Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act (IPERIA) of 2012, and the Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) of 2019, the Commission has made significant efforts to implement policies and procedures to strengthen internal controls that prevent improper payments.  In addition, the Commission utilizes a payment recapture program that includes both audits and transaction testing to search for and recapture overpayments.  Although the Commission has made strides to improve policies, procedures and controls over improper payments, there is still more work to be done.
In FY2023, the Commission had four programs that were in phase 2 reporting which included: (Universal Service Fund (USF-High Cost Legacy), (USF-Lifeline), (USF-Schools and Libraries) and the Telecommunications Relay Service (TRS).  As of FY2024, the Commission now has only two programs that meet the phase 2 reporting criteria. Those programs are the USF-High Cost Legacy program and the USF-Lifeline program.  
USF-High Cost legacy – The High Cost Legacy fund is the most complex program.  The improper payment increased slightly from 2.87% to 4.46% do mainly to carriers having inadequate documentation for their assets, the incorrect depreciation method being used and the lack of documentation.  In FY21, the Commission split the high cost program into two distinct programs based on the guidance from our OIG and OMB (high cost modernized and high cost legacy).  The High Cost Legacy program continues to be subject to significant risks at this time.  The Commission and our Administrator, the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), continues to focus their efforts on program integrity assurance activities such as collaborating with their Audit and Assurance Division partners to provide the annual circle of life webinars, meeting with the National Exchange Carrier Association and the continuation of existing analysis and data validations for the High Cost Legacy fund.  The high cost program has introduced a new compliance layer by developing additional program integrity assurance (PIA) procedures leveraging enhanced analytics and testing capabilities on a sample basis to identify potential violations.      
USF-Lifeline – The USF-Lifeline program has shown significant progress over the years, although this year the program’s improper payment rate increased from 2.18% to 5.98%.  The main causes for the increase include subscriber eligibility documentation loss in the National Lifeline Accountability Database (NLAD) due to a documentation loss incident, suspicious eligibility documentation and eligibility of participants accepted by a National Verifier opt-out state due to the use of old or outdated benefit identification cards (BIC).  The Lifeline program management continues to review the root cause of the errors identified in the assessments and continues to perform updates to training and materials related to the review of eligibility documentation and provide individual coaching for reviewers.  Since the program quality assurance (PQA) review period, USAC has increased quality assurance (QA) volumes to achieve a statistically valid, random sample for each eligibility program (Medicaid, SNAP, etc.) each month.  This allows USAC to see trends by program and target training/coaching more effectively.  USAC also just implemented a mandatory, semi-annual training for all manual review agents which will be a refresher training with focus on any concerning trends coming out of QA analysis.
USF-Schools and Libraries – The USF-Schools and Libraries program has reported an improper payment rate below the statutory threshold of 1.5% and $10 million for the first time since inception.  This year’s improper payment rate was 1.27% which is down from the previous year of 1.59%.  Although USAC and the Commission have made great strides in this program, there is still more work that can be done to keep the improper payment rate below the statutory thresholds.  The top two findings this year relate to competitive bidding of contracts and internal connection violations.  As corrective actions, the Schools and Libraries program continues the use of data analytics to identify potential competitive bidding violations and leverages the analytics to improve competitive bidding training and enhanced compliance through the addition of related web and training content.  The Schools and Libraries program continues to expand invoice pre-payment reviews to confirm internal connections are installed and operating.
Telecommunications Relay Service (TRS) – The TRS program continues to be below the statutory limits and is currently in phase 1 reporting criteria.
The Commission and its components continue to make great strides when it comes to oversight, internal control updates and implementation of policies and procedures.  Our ultimate goal is to bring all of our programs back to phase 1 reporting requirements although there is more work to be done in order to reach the goal.  With the Commission leadership, we continue to make much needed improvements in all of our programs each year.  The Commission takes seriously the recommendations provided by our OIG and its auditor so that our programs are in compliance with the guidance outlined in OMB M-21-19.

Improper Payments GNTCP18AL0064
The improper payments totaling $68,023.45 are divided into the following two categories:

1) Payments totaling $44,372.23 that were determined to be unallowable costs on award GNTCP18AL0064 and resulted in improper payment that must be reimbursed to the Council.

2) Payments totaling $23,651.22 that were determined to be unallowable on award GNTCP18AL0064 but were however, allowable to be transferred to a different Bucket 2 or Bucket 3 award.

As requested, ADCNR submitted remittance to the Council for the $44,372.23 in disallowed costs. Book entry adjustments to transfer the $23,651.22 in allowable costs to the appropriate grant awards will be conducted in ASAP during Q1 of FY25.


Improper Payment GT3CP22AL0001
An improper payment of $9,400 was identified on ADCNR award GT3CP22AL0001 in conjunction with a land acquisition transition for purchase.

The final appraisal value of $2,416,000 was $9,400 below the purchase agreement between ADCNR and the seller. During pre-acquisition discussions, Council staff approved $2,416,000 in RESTORE funds in alignment with the appraised value and ADCNR agreed that the $9,400 difference would be paid using additional state funds. 
Review of post-acquisition documentation provided by ADCNR, identified a discrepancy between the ASAP drawdown on 7/12/2024 and the amount of RESTORE funds approved for land acquisition closing. Based on the documentation, ADCNR requested an ASAP draw on 7/12/2024 of $2,431,583.52 and issued a check on 7/15/2024 for the full amount. This created an improper payment of $9,400.

Council staff are working with ADCNR to resolve the issue and recover the $9,400 in funds improperly paid.

In alignment with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA), HHS undertakes a range of payment integrity activities to address root causes of improper payments and enhance compliance.

FY 2024 Activities

During FY 2024, HHS conducted a series of initiatives to strengthen payment integrity, including:

1. Assessing improper payment risks across 89 programs, representing a 59% increase over FY 2023.
2. Enhancing risk assessment tools and methodologies.
3. Developing policies to assess all programs with outlays over $10 million.
4. Monitoring low-risk programs not subject to assessments.
5. Reporting quarterly data for seven high-priority programs on PaymentAccuracy.gov.
6. Publishing improper payment estimates for 11 programs.
7. Using assessment results to identify root causes and implement corrective actions.

Payment Integrity Results

In FY 2024, HHS reported improper and unknown payment estimates for 11 at-risk programs. While five programs saw a decrease in their payment error rates, five experienced increases. This mixed performance still led to an overall reduction in improper payments across the department. HHS also resumed reporting for Foster Care, which had paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Compliance Challenges

The FY 2023 compliance audit identified several areas of non-compliance:

- The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) had an improper payment rate exceeding 10%.
- Not all programs identified as risk-susceptible reported improper payment estimates.
- Medicare Part C showed limited progress in payment integrity.
- Risk assessments were not conducted for all programs with annual outlays over $10 million within the required three-year period.
- Delays in recovery audits for Medicare Part C were noted.
- Methodology issues affected the COVID-19 Uninsured Program's payment estimates.

Corrective Actions and Future Plans

To address compliance challenges, HHS has:

- Collaborated with states to develop corrective action plans for Medicaid and CHIP, resulting in CHIP's improper payment rate falling below 10%.
- Started measuring and reporting improper payments for Foster Care after resuming reviews.
- Proposed statutory changes in the FY 2025 budget to improve monitoring and reporting for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.
- Launched the Improper Payment Pre-testing and Assessment program for State-based Exchanges, advancing efforts to measure improper payments.
- Recovered overpayments from Medicare Part C Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) audits, starting with payment year 2018.

HHS remains committed to enhancing payment accuracy and will continue to refine methodologies and corrective actions to ensure compliance with PIIA requirements. Further details are available in the annual Agency Financial Report and on PaymentAccuracy.gov.","2024"

For Medicare Part C, contract-level Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) audits are used to confirm the accuracy of diagnoses submitted by Medicare Advantage Organizations, with overpayments recovered based on audit findings. In Medicare Part D, improper payments are identified through audits focusing on high-risk and high-cost drugs, and sponsors must recoup payments unless supporting documentation is provided. The Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) Recovery Audit Contractor issues demand letters to debtors, with interest accruing on unresolved balances, and may refer debts to the Department of the Treasury if not resolved.","2024"

2023-FO-0009 1A - Establish an improper payment council within HUD that consists of senior accountable officials from across the Department with a role in the effort that would work to identify risks and challenges to compliance and identify solutions as a collaborative group. This is a priority open recommendation. A final action target date has not been established for this recommendation because OCFO has not provided an acceptable proposed management decision*.

(Unit - Free-Text) ","The FY 2023 compliance audit identified six key areas of non-compliance, and the OIG provided recommendations for each, along with suggested actions and milestones by HHS to address the issues:

1. CHIP's Improper Payment Rate Exceeding 10%: The OIG recommended implementing more robust corrective action plans and providing technical assistance to states. HHS worked with states to create corrective action plans, combined with state flexibilities during the pandemic, resulting in CHIP's improper payment rate dropping below 10%. HHS will continue to monitor compliance and work with states to address any emerging issues.

2. Lack of Improper Payment Estimates for Risk-Susceptible Programs: The OIG advised that all programs identified as risk-susceptible should report improper payment estimates. HHS has begun addressing this by resuming measurement and reporting for the Foster Care program and launching the Improper Payment Pre-testing and Assessment program for State-based Exchanges. These efforts aim to establish more accurate and consistent reporting across all risk-susceptible programs.

3. Limited Progress in Medicare Part C Payment Integrity: To improve payment integrity for Medicare Part C, the OIG recommended accelerating corrective actions and recovery audits. HHS responded by recovering overpayments from Medicare Part C's Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) audits, starting with payment year 2018. HHS plans to continue enhancing audit processes and refine corrective actions for future recovery efforts.

4. Incomplete Risk Assessments for Programs with Outlays Over $10 Million: The OIG stressed the importance of conducting risk assessments for all such programs at least once every three years. In FY 2024, HHS significantly increased the number of programs assessed and plans to review all programs for significant improper payments by FY 2025, ensuring compliance with the three-year requirement.

5. Delays in Medicare Part C Recovery Audits: The OIG recommended expediting the audit process for timely identification and recovery of improper payments. HHS has taken steps to finalize past RADV audits and will implement a more structured timeline for future audits to prevent delays.

6. Methodology Issues in COVID-19 Uninsured Program Estimate: The OIG suggested refining the sampling and estimation methods to better capture program characteristics. HHS completed reporting for the COVID-19 Uninsured Program, providing a combined rate for the past two years of payments.

RHAP - Tenant Based Rental Assistance Section 8 Housing Certificate Fund & Tenant Based Rental Assistance

A payment recapture audit was deemed not be cost-beneficial based on the nature of these programs. Collectability is a concern as tenants may no longer be receiving housing assistance when the overpayments are identified, or many may not be able to repay the subsidy with their own resources. HSNG Owners/ PIH PHAs use the Enterprise Income Verification (EIV) system to verify tenant employment/income information and reduce administrative and subsidy payment errors in accordance with HUD administrative guidance. The program Points of Contact (POC) use EIV to monitor the owner’s compliance with access and use of the system. However, tenant files are stored locally at each Multifamily property and some RHAP activities are administered by PHAs nationwide. A recovery audit would involve substantial travel costs in addition to staff time. There are also no centralized computer database capturing documents used to support the rental subsidy determinations. Therefore, the cost of any additional attempts to recover improper payments would exceed the benefit of improper payments recovered.

II. Lack of Empirical Evidence
Choice Neighborhoods Initiative
Family Self-Sufficiency Program
Public Housing Capital Fund
Public Housing Operating Fund
Revitalization of Severely Distressed Public Housing (HOPE VI)
Research and Technology

The results of HUD’s payment integrity risk assessments identified these programs as not susceptible to significant improper payments. There is no empirical evidence, either through risk assessments, A-123 internal control reviews, and other monitoring reviews, that suggests significant improper payments exist within these programs and activities, and it is not likely that HUD would realize any benefit to payment recapture audits of these programs. Therefore, the cost of any additional attempts to recover improper payments would exceed the benefit of improper payments recovered.

III. Similar Overpayment Recovery Activities for CPD Programs
Capacity Building
Community Development Fund - Disaster Recovery Assistance (Hurricane Harvey, Irma, Maria)
Community Development Fund - Disaster Recovery Assistance (Louisiana, Texas, West Virginia, Hurricane IKE, Other Disasters)
Neighborhood Stabilization Program
Project Based Section 8 - Renewal of Expiring Sec. 8 Mod Rehab SRO
Self-Help Homeowner Opportunity Program (SHOP)
Community Project Funding - Community Project/Congressional Funding

The CPD funds have a monitoring process in place to assess the quality of performance of the grantee over time and promptly resolve the findings of audits and other reviews. Monitoring provides information about program participants that is critical for making informed judgments about program effectiveness and management efficiency. It also helps in identifying instances of fraud, waste, and abuse. The process involves frequent telephone/email contacts, written communications, analysis of reports and audits, and periodic meetings. Monitoring also provides opportunities to identify program participant accomplishments as well as successful management/ implementation/evaluation techniques that might be replicated by other CPD program participants. 
Parties involved include Special Need Assistance Programs (SNAP), Field Offices, Office of Policy Development and Coordination (OPDC), Office of Rural Housing and Economic Development (ORHED), Office of General Counsel (OGC), Budget and OCFO. CPD’s program exhibit 34-1a, Guide for Review of Financial Management and Audits, is designed to monitor non-federal entity’s compliance with requirements of Subparts D and F of 2 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, except for cost allowability, procurement and equipment. During the monitoring process, program expenditures are reviewed to determine if improper payments were made. If identified CPD determines whether the appropriate corrective actions took place. In most cases, CPD will recapture overpayments by offsetting future draws. Overpayments in the Neighborhood Stabilization Program are addressed through reduction of future allocations as opposed to future draws. If there are no remaining funds on the grant, HUD will typically instruct the grantee to either repay funds from non-federal funds sources to their grant’s line of credit in Line of Credit Control System (LOCCS) or to the Treasury’s account if the grant has been closed. A remittance to the line of credit of less than $2,000 may be made by sending a check to HUD-FAD Collections Ft. Worth PO Box 6200-05, whereas any remittance of more than $2,000 must be sent via wire transfer to the Department of U.S. Treasury’s Financial Communications System (TFCS). CPD programs could also withhold additional funding until the overpayment has been recovered. 
In addition, the results of HUD’s payment integrity risk assessment identified these programs as not susceptible to significant improper payments. Therefore, the cost of any additional attempts to recover improper payments would exceed the benefit of improper payments recovered.

IV. Similar Overpayment Recovery Activities for Ginnie Mae Programs
2500-Contractor Payments
3300-Master Sub-Servicer (MSS) Default Activity

For any overpayments identified, Ginnie Mae will either request reimbursement or offset future payments to the contractor. However, if there are no future invoices to be provided, Ginnie Mae will request reimbursement for the improper payment. To recover overpayments made to the General Services Administration (GSA) for invoice payments to a vendor, Ginnie Mae will process an IPAC. When the cost of recovering improper payments is greater than the benefits, then Ginnie Mae will not pursue any further actions than mitigating strategies as outlined already. 
As it relates to the Pass-Through Assistance Program (PTAP) program, which is new for 2021, the process for identifying improper payments includes validation of the request against the loan and pool information submitted to the Reporting and Feedback System (RFS), evaluation of the issuers equity and liquidity as reported with the PTAP request, and evaluation of the custodial account balance from which the Investor payments will be drawn.
The PTAP disbursement process is the same as in all Ginnie Mae disbursement requests. The PTAP disbursement request is processed for review and approval for payment. All payment requests are approved by an Independent Certifying Officer (ICO) (who accepts personal financial responsibility and criminal liability for improper payments they certify). The cost of recovering improper payments would exceed the benefit of improper payments recovered and would not be beneficial to the program.

V. Similar Overpayment Recovery Activities for Other Rental Assistance Programs
Project-Based Rental Assistance Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation
Rental Housing Assistance Program – Section 236

The results of HUD’s payment integrity risk assessment identified these programs as not susceptible to significant improper payments. All owners receiving funding from these programs are mandated by 24 CFR 5.233 to fully utilize HUD’s EIV system. EIV is a web-based application which provides owners with employment, wage, unemployment compensation and social security benefit information for tenants participating in HUD’s assisted housing programs. Tenant Rental Assistance Certification System (TRACS) is a system developed to improve the fiscal control over assisted housing programs and acts as the sole repository of all tenant certification data, assistance contract data and crucial payment data. EIV is matched against TRACS and a variance of $2,400 per year generates an error and owners are required to follow-up with the tenant and resolve the error. If an overpayment is identified, tenants may pay the owner in a lump sum or by entering into a repayment agreement. Therefore, the cost of any additional attempts to recover improper payments would exceed the benefit of improper payments recovered.

Of the thirty-eight (38) programs excluded from a Payment Recapture Audit, the remaining twenty (20) programs have other mechanisms in place to recover overpayments.

Specifically, the Multifamily portfolio   is comprised of (Section 8, Section 202, and Section 811), and will be referred to as project-based rental assistance (PBRA). The sheer scale and intricacy of this program presented a formidable challenge to payment integrity testing.  For the PBRA program, HUD is entrusted with the stewardship of over $15 billion in funds, that vast majority of which is paid  through contract administrators to property owners on behalf of the tenants the program serves. This multi-layered process, involving hardcopy documentation maintained by various entities introduces significant challenges for payment integrity testing.

In prior years, validating payments and identifying populations for testing within PBRA was a manual, resource-intensive process, hampered by decentralized document retention and varying procedures at the contract administrators. The existing basic sub-sampling approach yielded limited insights and risked overlooking errors further down the payment chain. HUD recognized the need for a transformation and responded with a series of innovations.

New templates and automation processes were introduced to streamline payment reconciliation and enhance data accuracy. The shift from basic sub-sampling to a sophisticated, statistically valid, discrete population testing methodology for FY2024 represented a significant leap forward. This approach independently tested both payment accuracy (Payee Tier) and tenant eligibility (Eligibility Tier),  providing unprecedented visibility into errors, their root causes at all levels, and precision rates. The payee tier measures the rate of accuracy of HUD payments to contract administrators, and the tenant eligibility tier measures the accuracy of contract administrator payments to property owners. This year HUD is only able to report on the payee tier payment accuracy. HUD does not yet have sufficient data to report on the eligibility tier payment accuracy. HUD aimed to reduce the burden on contract administrators while maintaining statistical validity. To protect sensitive information (PII), a secure SharePoint site was established, ensuring data privacy in the collection process from recipients. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) streamlined the tedious process of document collection and recipient coordination.

The variability in the contract administrators’ processes, controls, and documentation retention amplify the risk of improper payments, especially in the Payee Tier (payments from contract administrators to property owners),    a high-risk area highlighted by both HUD and the Office of Inspector General (OIG). This prompted HUD to focus significant resources on the Payee Tier testing, understanding that heightened risk exists outside HUD’s direct control.

HUD's enhanced FY2024 testing strategy did result in a reliable measurement of the Payee Tier: The Payee Tier showed a reliable (96% precision rate) unknown payment rate of a mere 0.30% ($45.2 million), significantly below statutory thresholds. This success demonstrates HUD's commitment to protecting taxpayer money. Eligibility Tier testing, however, revealed significant difficulties in retrieving evidence from the contract administrators to support the timely verification of tenant eligibility and any error rate estimation would be misleading based on a lack of precision in extrapolating an error rate.  The lack of precision prevented production of a reliable error rate for the Eligibility Tier.  As corrective actions, HUD is working to improve contract administrators’ timely evidence collection, retention, and submission through training and outreach. By implementing new technologies, refining methodologies, and engaging actively with stakeholders, HUD is not only safeguarding taxpayer dollars but also ensuring that vital housing assistance reaches those who need it most. While challenges remain, the progress made reflects HUD's dedication to transparency, efficiency, and accountability in managing its programs. HUD   will also continue working to improve the payment integrity and exploring a methodology that will ensure that tenant eligibility is accurate and reliable.   During FY 2024, HUD assessed existing technology solutions and planned improvements to determine effective controls within the Tenant Based Rental Assistance program for preventing and detecting improper payments as documented by the Public and Indian Housing IT modernization plan.  Currently, HUD’s Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH) Office of Field Operations (OFO) uses the Compliance Monitoring Review (CMR) tool and the Enterprise Income Verification (EIV) system to verify and validate information, such as accurate payment standards, income eligibility, eligibility determination, in PHA tenant files for accuracy.  Public housing agency’s (PHAs) subject to reviews are selected at random and performed both on site and in the virtual environment.  HUD explored using existing reports to estimate improper payment rates.  Existing reports did not meet stringent payment integrity requirements and could not produce reliable errors with an adequate precision rate that addressed the full payment life cycle, which includes payments from HUD to public housing authorities (PHAs), from PHAs to landlords, and considerations for eligibility verification.  HUD will continue the Public and Indian Housing IT modernization plan and determine approaches to test sub-populations. By exploring other approaches for testing, such as subdividing the TBRA PHA populations, HUD will be able to support some level of testing along with modernization efforts and tailor the testing approach. HUD’s modernization plans will benefit efforts to test the full payment life cycle for both payee and eligibility tiers through improvements to HUD’s Enterprise Voucher Management System (eVMS) and the Enhanced EIV tool.

However, due to the expiration of HUD's Computer Matching Agreement (CMA) with the Treasury in 2019, the agency has been unable to fully utilize DNP. This lapse has resulted in payments to entities with inactive or unregistered System for Award Management (SAM) statuses, indicating that the DNP Initiative has not been utilized consistently across HUD programs. Consequently, there has been an increase in the risk of improper payments, suggesting that the DNP Initiative, while potentially effective in reducing improper payments, has not been fully leveraged by the agency, thus failing to reduce improper payments as intended. HUD is currently clearing signatures for an updated computer matching agreement with Treasury.

During grant execution, the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH) reviews grantee invoices, vouchers and supporting documentation. If an improper payment is identified, the Government Technical Representative (GTR) or the COR, as applicable, provides fund recipients with documentation of the determination of the improper payment, the regulatory, grant-specific, and/or contractual basis for recovering the improper payment, a due date for recoupment, and a due-process opportunity to appeal. The appeal, if made, goes to the Grants Division Director (for grants) or the COR (for contracts), as applicable. Should the request not be appealed, or the appeal denied, and the funding recipient did not refund the improper payment, the matter would be referred to the OGC for action. 
During the close-out of a grant, if it is determined that a financial error occurred, the grantee is asked to provide an explanation for the problem and, if required by the GTR, the grantee submits a check to resolve the financial shortfall. The COR forwards the check and a letter of explanation to the Budget Officer for the recapturing of funds. 
In addition, the GTR includes a copy of the check and the letter of explanation with the close-out package to the Grants Officer. The Grants Officer documents the returned funds on form HUD-1044 (Assistance Award/Assistance). OLHCHH’s process assures quality spending and monitoring for reimbursable funding. The likelihood of improper reimbursements are low due to several reasons. OLHCHH is a reimbursement program; the funds distributed are for services that have already been completed and invoiced. Additionally, every three months, grantees submit information on work performed and provide a financial statement using the Federal Financial Report (SF-425), HUD-Part 3 Budget form, and supporting documentation. The SF-425, HUD-Part 3 Budget form, and the LOCCS VRS Request Voucher for Grant Payment (form HUD-27053) must match data in LOCCS and all totals must be the same.

Salaries and Expenses
For the Payroll, Benefits and Retirement Division (PBRD), The Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) reviews the unpaid report to ensure all HUD employees are paid based on their certified timecard for the Personnel Office Identifier (POI) 4408. If erroneous payments were made due to an error in personnel and benefits, OCHCO then takes the necessary action(s) to rectify the mistake. For example, OCHCO collaborates with the BFS and the Department of Agriculture’s National Finance Center (NFC) to run all the necessary reports to determine where the discrepancy was made. Once the source has been identified, OCHCO corrects the issue or determines if it is feasible to correct the improper payment. Through the PBRD quality review process, overpayments are identified and validated. Once validated and corrected through the NFC database, the debt is generated, and the employee is notified of the indebtedness. After due process, the collection process is initiated. 
Also, the Human Resources (HR) Division performs a quality review based on the personnel data generated from the NFC FOCUS report or NFC Reporting Center application for personnel and benefits actions. The report data is used to determine, personnel data or duty locations which will cause an overpayment for the employee. If so, the History Correction Update Processing (HCUP) system is used to correct the error, which will automatically generate a bill if it is within twenty-six (26) pay periods. Outside of the pay period timeframe, HR will manually calculate the amount owed and enter the data to be submitted to NFC via the Special Payroll Processing System (SPPS). The employee will be informed of the indebtedness; and have an opportunity to setup a payment plan. 
As part of the bi-weekly payroll projection process, OCFO-Budget runs reports from OBI’s repository of payroll reports and flags any payroll corrections or unusual payroll activities for program budget offices. Upon request and on an ad-hoc basis, OCFO-Budget provides assistance in the correction of improper payroll payments by running reports from OBI’s repository of payroll reports (Cost and Hours report) and providing data regarding payroll corrections to program budget offices and Treasury’s ARC. 
The Administrative Control of Funds Policies Handbook outlines procedures and points to additional guidance program offices follow that can lead to the identification, recovery, and prevention of future improper payments.

The MFNSB is responsible for overseeing all fiscal loan servicing activities for MF and Healthcare mortgage notes assigned to the Secretary. MF and Healthcare notes include both the Mutual Mortgage Insurance /Cooperative Management Housing Insurance and General Insurance /Special Risk Insurance for financing and liquidating accounts. The FHA has contracted with a Servicing and Accounting Contractor and utilizes their proprietary-owned system to maintain records for all transactions relating to the assignment, servicing, and disposition of the MF notes portfolio. The MFNSB is responsible for overseeing all fiscal loan servicing activities for MF and Healthcare mortgage notes assigned to the Secretary. MF and Healthcare notes include both the Mutual Mortgage Insurance /Cooperative Management Housing Insurance and General Insurance /Special Risk Insurance for financing and liquidating accounts. The FHA has contracted with a Servicing and Accounting Contractor and utilizes their proprietary-owned system to maintain records for all transactions relating to the assignment, servicing, and disposition of the MF notes portfolio. Each note is serviced in accordance with the mortgage and mortgage note documents. Servicing activities include billing, collections, disbursements, escrow management, and processing of terminations. Servicing activities are performed daily until termination of the note from the system. 
Taxes and R4R escrows are incorporated into the note and managed by the note. Amounts collected are all pre-determined by the language within the note itself. Payment amounts (R4R costs, insurance, taxes and miscellaneous A/P) are calculated based on invoices submitted. 
All disbursements are initially processed by the contractor. However, the Multifamily Notes Servicing Branch (MFNSB) staff have final approval on all disbursements. No disbursements are made by the contractor without approval from the MFNSB. Disbursements are approved by HUD. 
Each payment request has an invoice and physical approval. Separation of duties is maintained for the disbursement process. Contract staff create the transmittal to allow the disbursement; a second contract staff approves the transmittal; a third contract staff creates the disbursement. None of the staff have the authority to perform any other duty in the payment process. Upon receipt of the disbursement request from the contractor, it is reviewed by MFNSB staff to ensure the requested disbursement is correct and in compliance with HUD guidelines. Employees conduct data matching analytics to verify key information for disbursements such as project name, address, FHA number, iREMS number, and dollar amount. For payment schedules the Tax ID Number, Routing Number, Deposit Account Number, and Dollar Amount are validated against supporting documentation to ensure accuracy. 
Once the disbursements are reviewed and approved by MFNSB, they are sent to the Cash Management Branch (CMB) for certification and processing. Payments are disbursed directly to the vendor responsible for collecting the disbursement and applying the funds to the expense. Contract staff perform daily banking functions to ensure all checks have been cashed and ACH transactions processed. 
Once the Certifying Officer in CMB certifies the schedule for payment, CMB sends the Secure Payment System (SPS) Report via email to the MFNSB. Staff compares the schedule payment package to the daily SPS Report and to the Goal Report Agency Location Codes (ALC) Payment Details to ensure the payment information is correct. In addition, all cash activities are reconciled through monthly accounting reconciliations. These payments are also post payment checked 
On a monthly basis, the MFNSB Chief conducts random sampling of payment schedules. A sampling of 20% of paid schedules is selected and reviewed for accuracy of information and payment. There have been no inaccuracies or overpayments cited. In the event of an overpayment of taxes or hazard insurance, the contractor will work with the tax authority or insurance provider to recoup the overpayment. If the contractor is unable to recover the funds they will escalate the issue to MFNSB, which will work with the account executive, the Office of General Counsel, and the program area to ensure the overpayment is recaptured. In the event of an overpayment of R4R, the contractor will work with the management agent to recoup the overpayment. If the management agent fails to return the overpayment within 30 days, MFNSB will notify the account executive and program area. The overpayment will be included in the next scheduled billing statement and the management agent will be issued a formal notification of the action.

Federal Housing Administration
The Office of Housing-Federal Housing Administration’s (HSNG–FHA) recovery audit program is part of its overall program of effective internal control over payments. Internal control policies and procedures establishes a system to monitor improper payments and their causes, and includes controls and actions for detecting, preventing, and recovering improper payments. On a recurring basis, these programs generate reports that identify potentially duplicate disbursements. These disbursements are researched, and recovery actions are initiated for payments deemed improper. As part of the recapture audit plan, internal control documents and files are reviewed, and post claim reviews are performed.
Under Title I and Other Debt Collection Guidance Handbook 4740.2, the Financial Operation Center (FOC) is primarily responsible for generic debt collection and customer service activities, including responding to debtor inquiries regarding pay-off, payment plans, compromises, disputes, and appeals. The debt referral package primarily consists of copies of legal documents, mortgages, deeds of trust, judgments and other recorded lien documents, lien assignment documents, repayment agreements, credit reports, correspondence to/from debtors, and compromise agreements and supporting documents.
The FOC is responsible for managing the business operations for the Title I loan program, which includes registering and endorsing loans for insurance, billing and collecting premiums, and examining claims for loss and approving them for payment. The FOC is also responsible for performing the debt collection and servicing activities for Title I Notes (defaulted Title I loans) and generic debts (other FHA debts).
The Title I program authorizes HUD to insure lenders against default on loans used to finance property improvements and to purchase manufactured homes. Lenders are required to pay premiums covering the insurance of their loans and submit applications for insurance benefits for defaulted loans. HUD is required to collect the unpaid loan balance, including eligible expenses, from the defaulted borrower.
The FOC’s Title I Insurance Processing Branch (TIIPB) is responsible for evaluating and approving lender applications for insurance benefits. The lender’s application must include loan information and any documentation necessary for the TIIPB to calculate a claim payment. There are three types of claim: initial, resubmitted, and supplemental. An initial claim is a first submission. A resubmitted claim is one that the TIIPB had previously denied. A supplemental claim is an additional claim for the same loan when the lender finds documentation for expenses not included in the initial claim. TIIPB support staff establish the claim in the Title I Insurance and Claims System (TIIS/F72). The process includes assigning a claim number, entering the date the claim was received, and assigning the claim to a TIIPB examiner. The examiner conducts a full review of the claim to determine whether the loan complies with Title I underwriting and servicing requirements and whether expenses claimed by the lender are supported by the documentation provided. If these conditions are satisfied, the examiner processes the claim calculation and authorization for payment in TIIS/F72. TIIS/F72 processes the payments authorized on the same day in a single batch file, sends the file to Treasury’s Payment Application Modernization system, and sends another file to the Cash Management Branch to authorize the Treasury disbursement. TIIS/F72 sends a file of paid claims to the Debt Collection and Management System – Title I (DCAMS-TI/F71), which converts the paid claims to notes receivable. The FOC’s Asset Recovery Division (ARD) is responsible for pursuing collection against the debtor (defaulted borrower).
The TIIPB conducts quality reviews of paid Title I claims to ensure consistent processing and examination quality. Each month, the TIIPB Branch Chief randomly selects 10% of paid claims for review. The Branch Chief either reviews the claim themselves or assigns them to examiners for a peer review. The reviewer conducts a full examination of the claim and reports whether the claim payment was conforming (compliant/no deficiencies), deficient (minor issues to address), unacceptable (serious issues to address), or mitigated (issues found but readily resolved). The outcomes of quality reviews are documented in both the Case Notes screen of TIIS/F72 and in the Title I Quality Reviews folder of the FOC’s SharePoint site.
If the review identified a deficiency that resulted in an overpaid claim, the TIIPB Branch Chief or examiner will issue a request to the lender for a full (for an unacceptable claim) or partial (for a deficient claim) repurchase of the loan. The request instructs the lender to repurchase the loan by remitting payment to a designated lockbox within 30 days or to ask for a reconsideration of the repurchase request within 10 days. If the lender fails to submit documentation that satisfactorily resolves the deficiency or to remit payment within the established timeframes, TIIPB issues a repurchase demand which gives the lender 30 days to remit the repurchase funds and informs the lender of the actions HUD will take if the funds aren’t remitted, including transferring the unpaid repurchase to the FOC’s ARD for delinquent debt collection, which includes referral to the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) for administrative offset.
Both paid and unpaid repurchase requests and demands involve coordination between the FOC’s TIIPB and ARD. The ARD ensures that the Title I Note receivable is reclassified as a full or partial repurchase. Payments for full and partial repurchases are sent to the Title I Notes lockbox which transmits a collection file to DCAMS-TI/F71 to credit the funds to the Title I Note receivable associated with the claim. The ARD notifies the TIIPB when repurchase funds are received and the TIIPB updates the claim record in TIIS/F72 (subfunction J04). For full repurchases, the ARD closes the Title I Note receivable as repurchased. Before closing out the receivable, the ARD will issue the debtor (defaulted Title I borrower) a refund for any non-repurchase collections received. The TIIPB returns the original claim binder to the lender along with an executed reassignment of the Title I promissory note and lien, if applicable.
Unpaid full or partial repurchase requests and demands are transferred to the ARD for delinquent debt collection. The ARD establishes a Title I Repurchase receivable in the Debt Collection and Asset Management System – Generic Debt (DCAMS-GD/F71A), which initiates the collection process by issuing an automated demand letter describing the debt and instructing the lender to remit payment in full within 30 days or contact the designated ARD Debt Servicing Representative (DSR) to request a plan to repay the debt in installments. If the lender does not pay the debt in full or enter a repayment plan within 30 days, DCAMS-GD/F71A issues a Notice of Intent (NOI) to Collect by Administrative Offset. The NOI notifies the lender that HUD intends to refer the debt to the TOP, describes the TOP process for administrative offset of federal payments, and provides the lender with steps to take to contest the basis of the debt or the amount demanded by filing an appeal with HUD’s Board of Appeals (BOA) within 65 days. If the lender files an appeal, DCAMS-GD/F71A suspends referral to TOP pending a decision and order from the BOA administrative law judge. (BOA adjudicates appeals by gathering and evaluating statements and documents from both parties.) If the BOA judge issues a decision and order declaring the debt unenforceable, the ARD closes the debt as unenforceable and notifies the TIIPB. The TIIPB will reverse the pending repurchase in TIIS/F72. If the decision and order results in a dismissal of the lender’s appeal, the DSR updates debt status in DCAMS-GD/F71A making the debt eligible for referral to TOP. DCAMS-GD/F71A refers eligible debts that are 121 or more days delinquent to TOP and the Treasury Cross-Servicing Program. DCAMS-GD/F71A also reports lenders to commercial credit reporting agencies (Dun & Bradstreet, Experian, and Equifax).
The TIIPB may, rather than transfer the unpaid repurchase to the ARD for delinquent debt collection, pursue internal offset of payments on subsequent claims submitted by the lender. In most cases, however, it’s more effective to transfer the debt to the ARD, since any federal payment made to the lender, including Title I claim payments, will be collected through TOP.
Collections, both voluntary and involuntary, received on a Title Repurchase debt are credited to the account. When a debt is paid in full, the ARD makes entries in DCAMS-GD/F71A to close out the debt as paid in full and to close out the Title I Note receivable as unenforceable. The TIIPB makes entries in TIIS/F72 (subfunction J04) to acknowledge satisfaction of the repurchase demand and returns the original claim binder to the lender along with an executed reassignment of the Title I Promissory Note and lien, if applicable.
 If the ARD concludes that the Title I Repurchase debt is uncollectible, it takes steps to close out the debt in DCAMS-GD/F71A, which will issue an IRS Form 1099-C to the lender and report the debt accordingly to the IRS. The TIIPB will pursue secondary recovery activities on the uncollectible repurchase by internally offsetting future claims payments to the lender or blocking payments on subsequent claims submitted by the lender. The TIIPB may also refer the lender to FHA’s Mortgagee Review Board for sanctions
The Debt Collection Asset Management System (DCAMS) is the application used to support the generic debt collection process. DCAMS is designed to automatically send collection letters, report delinquent debt to credit bureaus and HUD’s Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System (CAIVRS), assess penalties and administrative costs, and refer eligible debts to the TOP and Cross-Servicing. Based on predefined criteria and the status of that case as reflected in DCAMS data fields (not later than 180 days after the demand letter), DCAMS is consistently updated to prevent improper referral for TOP offset.
For internal offsets, over-claimed amounts (negative claims) occur when the mortgagee owes FHA. The Single-Family Claims Branch (SFCB) sends billing letters to lenders for the excess amounts claimed and tracks the receivables using the Accounts Receivables Sub-system (ARS). Receivables are established in SFCB’s ARS and identified by an FHA case number. Each FHA case number is further identified by Section of the Act (which is linked to the appropriate fund) and endorsement date. This later date identifies the cohort year. The Holder of record to which the claim funds were originally disbursed is identified in ARS as the debtor, by default. When the receivable is subsequently liquidated by funds remitted by a Mortgagee or by offset, the collected amount is posted to the previously identified FHA case number, Section of the Act, and cohort year.
If a payment is not received from a lender within 90 days, the receivable is offset against subsequent claims by the lender until the full amount of the receivable is satisfied. If a receivable is not satisfied within 120-150 days, it is referred to the FOC in Albany, NY for enforced collection actions. At that time, the FOC officially confirms acceptance of the transfer of an aged delinquent debt, and that receivables have been removed from the ARS with the notation that it has been referred to the FOC for recovery.
Another avenue by which improper payments are recaptured is through Post Claim Reviews for title II Single Family Insurance Claims. A statistical sample of settled claims is reviewed for compliance with FHA servicing and claim filing requirements. A report on findings, is prepared and issued to the individual mortgagee. Mortgagees can refute the findings by providing additional documents before a final report is issued. If the Mortgagee chooses to pay the monetary findings prior to HUD’s issuance of the final report, those funds are deposited to ARS, which applies them to the Mortgage Insurance (MI) fund. Upon issuance of the final report, it is referred to the FOC which establishes it as a receivable and tracks it until paid in full. If a lender is overpaid on a Multifamily claim, the Multifamily Claims Branch will demand the overage back from the lender, which is usually resolved within 30 days of final settlement. The mortgagee either returns the overpaid funds or files a supplemental claim. If the overpayment is not resolved within the 30-day or 60-day period after final settlement, the reviewer sends a follow-up letter at the end of each period advising the mortgagee of the penalties and interest assessed. If still not resolved after 90 days, the overpayment is electronically transferred to HUD’s FOC in Albany, New York for collection. Lastly, for Treasury Cross-Servicing, the collection of generic debt is governed by the Debt Collection Improvement Act and HUD policies (Title I and Other Debt Collection Guidance 4740.2). The Act requires federal agencies to refer eligible delinquent debts to Treasury (for Cross-Servicing and TOP) when the debt is 120 days delinquent.
The Treasury’s TOP allows federal agencies to report delinquent non-tax debt to the BFS. BFS performs computer matching with disbursement data and processes an offset when an appropriate match is determined. After referral, Treasury and its private collection agencies are responsible for contacting the debtor to collect the payment of the debt. The Treasury’s Cross-Servicing is a process used by BFS to refer the debt collection to a private collection agency, among other actions, to collect delinquent debts on behalf of Federal Agencies.
The FOC’s recapture process establishes receivables in DCAMS and issues a demand notice to the debtor(s). If the debt remains unpaid, DCAMS issues a “Notice of Intent” warning regarding enforced collection measures and informs the debtor regarding their due process rights. DCAMS automatically reports information to credit bureaus and CAIVRS. Penalty and administrative cost charges are also automatically assessed if warranted.
If the debt remains unpaid, it is referred to Treasury (within 180 days) for offset via the government-wide TOP and for direct collection action by Treasury and Treasury contracted private collection agencies. Treasury also initiates referral to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for civil litigation and/or initiates Administrative Wage Garnishment (AWG) action if they deem such action to be appropriate.
If Treasury’s Cross-Servicing action is not successful, Treasury “returns” the debt to the FOC. If older than two years, the receivable is written-off and the case is reclassified “currently not collectible.” The FOC keeps the case open if offset via TOP appears fruitful or if other collection measures are applicable (e.g., AWG action by HUD). Otherwise, the FOC terminates collection action, closes the case, and the system issues an IRS Form 1099C “Cancellation of Debt,” the following January if appropriate. Write-off, Termination, close-out, and 1099C issuance can also occur at any point in the above collection cycle if determined appropriate (e.g., debtor is discharged as bankrupt).
Collections from debtors to HUD go to the Treasury Lockbox Network or Pay.gov. Collections from debtors to Treasury or DOJ come to HUD via interagency transfer (i.e., Intra-Governmental Payment and Collection (IPAC)). No matter the route, all payments are posted to the receivable in DCAMS.

This is an on-line database management system with control exercised primarily on an exception basis. The system was designed to speed the payment of mortgagees’ claims, reduce paperwork burdens, enhance the level of control, and improve service.  The integrity of this automated claims processing system is dependent on mortgagee compliance with HUD’s claim processing requirements.  Expenses are reported by category on the claim form and must be supported by a complete claim file maintained by the mortgagee.  Mortgagees are not required to furnish receipts for reimbursable expenses at the time insurance benefits are claimed.  Therefore at the time the claims are paid to the mortgagee, they would not have provided documentation to support all of the amounts and expenses claimed, as the amounts may have been automatically processed.  After the claims have been paid to the mortgagee, a post claim review will be conducted to audit the servicer's portfolio to determine if any amounts are inappropriate, unsupported, or overpaid, and therefore is recovered in a post claim review.

(Unit - Free-Text) ","In the FY 2023 annual compliance audit, OPM OIG found that OPM’s FEHB Program was not in compliance with four of the ten PIIA reporting requirements (3, 4, 5b and 6).    

The OIG determination was based upon the FEHB Program not reporting an Improper Payment Estimate in FY 2023. The OIG recommended OPM issue an improper payment estimate for the Federal Employees Health Benefit program that will allow OPM to be in compliance with PIIA reporting requirements in future reporting years. 

OPM is expeditiously implementing the actions needed for OPM to be compliant with PIIA reporting.  In FY 2022, OPM’s OCFO/Risk Management and Internal Controls (RMIC) office performed a risk assessment of the FEHB Program.  That risk assessment determined the FEHB Program was susceptible to significant improper payments, thus requiring OPM to report an IP estimate in FY 2023.  OPM immediately started developing a new improper payment methodology.  While developing the new methodology, OPM determined that the FEHB Program should be differentiated into two activities for OMB reporting purposes. The FEHB Program has different contracts, payment structures, and improper payment types for the Experience-Rated Carriers and Community Rated Carriers, meriting meaningfully different sampling and estimation methodology plans. Off-cycle risk assessments were conducted for both new activities, with only the FEHB Experience-Rated Carriers determined susceptible to significant improper payments.  As the Community-Rated Carriers activity was not determined to be susceptible to significant improper payments, OPM is not required to report an improper and unknown payment estimate.

OPM developed a new improper payment methodology in FY 2023 and actively engaged with agency stakeholders and FEHB Carriers to meet the PIIA requirements.   In FY 2024, OPM issued Carrier Letter 2024-15 Guidance on Audited Financial Statements for Federal Fiscal Year 2024. This Carrier Letter included the 2024 FEHBP Financial Reporting and Audit Guide, which provides detailed requirements for the financial reporting for all FEHB Experience-Rated carriers, including audit requirements and improper payment reporting. In FY 2024, OPM conducted training on the Financial Reporting and Audit Guide for all Experience-Rated Carriers and their Independent Public Accountants. OPM requires time to implement the new improper payment methodology, as the FEHB Experience-Rated Carriers need time to collect, audit, and report their data back to OPM. OPM anticipates being in compliance with PIIA in FY 2025.","2024"

The OIG recommended: 
(1) that OPM issue an improper payment estimate for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program’s that will allow them to be in compliance with the four PIIA requirements for future reporting years; 
(2) that Healthcare and Insurance contact OMB to obtain guidance on how to report an improper payment estimate in a fiscal year when a program has been separated into two different activities to develop an appropriate sampling and estimation methodology plan; 
(3) Risk Management and Internal Control strengthen its internal controls to show that management is performing supervisory control activities (e.g., a supervisory level of review) for all risk assessments conducted and that the review is documented and retained, (e.g., electronic signatures);

(Unit - Free-Text)","Benefit Payments disburses over $5 billion in payments annually to over 800,000 participants each month.
Due to the dollar value, payment volume, program complexity, and nature of pension payments, PBGC has implemented electronic data analysis, including death match and other procedures, to identify
payments that may be in error. Potential improper payments are subjected to further analysis based on the amount of the payment, the nature of the potential error, and other risk factors to determine whether amounts are due to PBGC. PBGC has established procedures to recapture overpayments through recovery payments, installment repayment agreements, offsets against other continuing benefits to recoup amounts owed by the participant, or referrals to the Department of Treasury’s Centralized Receivables Service. In some cases, recapture of payments may not be sought based on demonstration that a participant is experiencing financial hardship or other reasons.

Contractor Payments includes the disbursement of over $300 million annually. Due to the dollar value, payment volume, and the nature of contract payments, PBGC has implemented electronic data analysis,
including do not pay matching and other procedures, to identify payments that may be in error. In addition, invoice reviews are periodically performed to help assess the accuracy of amounts billed. Potential improper payments are subjected to further analysis based on the amount of the payment, the nature of the potential error, and other risk factors to determine whether amounts are due to PBGC. PBGC has established procedures under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to seek reimbursement from contractors that have been overpaid. Further, under the FAR, previous payments are made are generally subject to adjustment based on over or under payments and any amounts due are normally addressed prior to or at contract closeout.

Payments to Federal Employees includes disbursement of about $150 million annually. PBGC’s payroll and other employee payments are processed by the Department of the Interior’s (DOI) Interior Business Center (IBC). PBGC receives a Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 18 report that reports on the DOI IBC payment operations. No weaknesses related to payroll and other employee payments were reported in the most recent SSAE No. 18. Included in PBGC’s and DOI’s internal controls are that a series of personnel actions are needed to change salaries or process bonus payments. Also, employees receive a payroll statement every two weeks. While mistakes can occur in any operation, PBGC has not experienced significant levels of improper payroll payments. Also, if a mistake is identified, any overpayments can be netted against or offset future payments to those employees or deducted from the last paycheck processed after termination. A review of the following did not identify significant payment issues:
>Improper payment risk assessments,
>agency Inspector General reviews,
>Government Accountability Office reports, and
>results of the agency audit resolution and follow up process.

Given the historic low risk nature of payroll disbursements, including the existence of adequate payment processing controls and reviews, and the ability to readily recover any improper payments by offset
against future payments through normal payroll operations, establishing a separate payment recapture program for this payment stream is unnecessary and would not be cost effective.

Multiemployer Plan Financial Assistance includes disbursement of over $160 million per year. MEPD generally processes an average of 357 financial assistance payments annually to an average of 95 plans. Multiemployer plans are required to provide proof of plan insolvency, sign promissory agreements, and undergo an initial audit to determine if the plan is eligible to receive ongoing assistance from the PBGC.
Additionally, multiemployer plans are required to provide documentation to support estimates of future expenses prior to receiving financial assistance on a yearly, semi annually, quarterly, or monthly basis.
The PBGC’s Multiemployer Program Division (MEPD) reviews all financial assistance requests in accordance with established policies and procedures to verify requests are reasonable, complete, accurate, and comply with ERISA. MEPD rejects or reduces the amount of financial assistance requested by plans if the administrative and/or benefit expenses do not agree to supporting documentation or if there was a prior overpayment. Additionally, throughout the year, plans submit documentation to support actual expenses incurred to validate a plan’s previous estimate of plan expenses and adjust the most recent financial assistance request amount if the actual amount of expenses significantly varied from the plan’s initial estimate, and MEPD auditors review this documentation and perform a detailed reconciliation.
Multiemployer plans are insolvent and generally have no other sources of financial resources beyond PBGC. In addition, there are just over 100 plans, so this is not a large universe of payees to monitor within the existing structure. A review of the following did not identify significant payment issues:
>improper payment risk assessment
>agency Inspector General reviews,
>Government Accountability Office reports, and
>results of the agency audit resolution and follow up process.
Given the lower payment dollar value and volume, the nature of the multiemployer plan financial assistance program, payment processing controls, and the ability to adjust future financial assistance
amounts by actual expenses incurred, establishing a separate payment recapture program for this payment stream would not be considered cost effective.

Premium Refunds issued ranges roughly $88 to $203 million on an annual basis. All premium refund requests are subject to review prior to disbursement with larger payments subjected to additional
approvals. Given that each pension plan has an ongoing account with PBGC as to premium amounts due, any adjustments for under or over payments can be reflected in the PBGC’s Statement of Account for each plan. Plans may contest any attempt to recapture overpayments. A review of the following did not identify significant payment issues:
> Improper payment risk assessments,
> agency Inspector General reviews,
> Government Accountability Office reports, and
> results of the agency audit resolution and follow up process.

Based on above and especially since there is not significant dollar value or payment volume associated with this payment stream, establishing a separate payment recapture program for this payment stream is not considered cost effective.","2024"

"NASA","exs1","[exs1] Provide an executive summary of the payment integrity activities and results for the agency for this reporting period (SEE - 'Helpful Hint' - minimum length requirements vary depending on Agency status). (Unit - Free-Text)","In its review of NASA’s FY 2023 Payment Integrity Risk Assessment (IG-23-013), the NASA Office of the Inspector General (OIG) concluded that NASA complied with the Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA). NASA remains committed to preventing and reducing improper payments through its Payment Integrity Improvement Program (PIIP) and annually conducts a Payment Integrity Risk Assessment and updates its risk assessment methodology. Updates to the risk assessment methodology are made as appropriate regarding changes to improper payment legislation and guidance, changes to NASA’s operating environment, recommendations from external auditors, and other circumstances. NASA performed its FY 2024 Payment Integrity Risk Assessment using methodology which incorporates seven risk conditions which are cross-walked to the eleven OMB-designated risk factors. 

M-21-19 indicates that all programs with annual outlays over $10,000,000 fall into one of two possible classifications: Phase 1 or Phase 2. Programs that are not likely to have annual improper payments and annual unknown payments above the statutory threshold are in Phase 1. Programs likely to annually make IPs plus UPs above the statutory threshold are Phase 2 programs. NASA currently has no Phase 2 programs. 

For the FY 2024 assessment, NASA extracted the population of FY 2023 disbursements ($27.91 billion) from its financial management system to develop a list of programs with outlays greater than $10 million. That list of programs was further narrowed, per NASA’s three-year assessment cycle scope, to include only new programs which had outlays greater than $10 million or programs which had crossed the $10 million threshold for the first time. Additionally, NASA considered whether programs had significant changes and would therefore require an off-cycle assessment. Accordingly, NASA conducted risk assessments for three programs in FY 2024. None of the programs were found to be susceptible to significant improper payments. 

NASA maintains payment integrity through strong internal controls including both preventative controls (e.g., payment approval processes) and detective controls (e.g., the continuous monitoring program).

For example, under SOP 00 02, Internal Control Systems, management board members (i.e., Senior Management Council) and district directors are responsible for maintaining effective systems of internal controls. Additionally, under SOP 20 31, Internal Control, senior management is responsible for establishing and monitoring, within their areas of responsibility, an internal control structure that provides reasonable assurance that operations are being run in an efficient and effective manner and comply with applicable laws and regulations.  Moreover, all SES-level senior management staff also has an enterprise integrity element within their performance plans with a benchmark goal to ensure compliance with relevant policies, procedures, and controls within their respective organization to effectively identify, prevent, monitor, manage and mitigate enterprise and fraud risks; be responsible for prompt and responsive participation during any audit (GAO, OIG, and Financial), receiving and analyzing draft and final audit reports, providing timely responses to the audit organization, and taking corrective action when required while ensuring the accuracy of their organization’s information in the SBA Integrity System throughout the audit process; and develop and implement robust internal controls as well as rigorous improper payment assessments.","2024"

of the agency's Payment Integrity risk assessment conducted in FY 2023.
PIIA requires agencies to review and assess all programs and activities with annual outlays greater than $10,000,000 for improper payment risk at least once every three years to identify those susceptible to significant improper payments.
In FY 2024, PBGC performed a risk assessment of three payment streams in accordance with our three-year rotation strategy. The three payment streams reviewed during FY 2024 were Multiemployer Special
Financial Assistance Payments, Benefit Payments and Premium Refunds. In performing the risk assessments, PBGC considered factors specified in statute and further defined in OMB guidance, including the
complexity of the payment stream; the volume of payments; recent major changes in program funding, authorities, practices, or procedures; the level, experience, and quality of training for personnel responsible
for making program eligibility determinations or certifying that payments are accurate; whether the program is new to the agency; whether payments or payment eligibility decisions are made outside of PBGC; significant deficiencies in the audit reports issued by the PBGC Office of Inspector General (OIG) and the Government Accountability Office (GAO); similarities to other programs that have reported improper
payments (IP) and unknown payments (UP) estimates; the accuracy and reliability of IP and UP estimates previously reported for the program; whether the program lacks information or data systems to confirm eligibility; and the risk of fraud as assessed by the agency under the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government published by the Government Accountability Office.
Based on the results of the Phase 1 risk assessments, PBGC determined that the Multiemployer Special Financial Assistance Payments, Benefit Payments and Premium Refunds were not susceptible to significant risk of improper payments as defined by the law and OMB implementation guidance.","2024"

The NLRB is required by the PIIA to assess the disbursement process and estimate the amount of improper payments every three years. The NLRB’s latest IPIA assessment and review performed by an independent consultant in FY 2022 concluded that the NLRB program and activities were at a low risk for improper payments.

For FY 2024, NLRB processed $301,528,874 in disbursements which included payroll and benefits of $235,107,439 and travel of $1,216,528. In addition, the NLRB paid $65,204,907 to vendors which accounted for 22 percent of the total disbursements.

The NLRB’s independent review evaluated the procedures in the Agency’s payment and disbursement processes. It also tested and assessed the design and effectiveness of internal controls. Given these controls, the IPIA assessment found no improper payment in the testing and found that the estimated improper payments to be within the thresholds defined by IPIA. Thus, improper payments for the NLRB’s programs did not exceed $10 million and 1.5 percent of the program total expenditures or $100 million of the total program expenditures. The Agency estimates the improper payments rate to be at most 1.5 percent and the improper payment amount to be no more than $4,522,933. Therefore, the NLRB has effective procedures and controls in place for its payment and disbursement processes. The NLRB has reasonable assurance that controls over financial and non-financial operations are sufficient. No additional reporting requirements are necessary.

The MATPSC remittance process requires a method of payment (check, money order, debit or credit card) and a corresponding payment coupon necessary to update a debtor’s record.  In fiscal year (FY) 2021, as part of the Debt Management Product, we implemented several improvements to our remittance process.  In FY 2021, we started accepting repayment of benefit overpayments through the Department of the Treasury’s (Treasury) Pay.gov via credit or debit card and automated clearing house (ACH); i.e., a checking or savings account.  In addition to this effort, we partnered with Treasury to use U.S. Bank, a financial agent for Treasury, to implement a lockbox service to assist with our paper remittance processing efforts at the MATPSC.  Lastly, we implemented Online Bill Pay (OLBP), allowing debtors to make a one-time or recurring ACH draft from a bank account using a personal computer or mobile phone.  In FY 2023, we extended the lockbox service to include Supplemental Security Income remittances.  These enhancements now account for approximately 51 percent of our remittance activity.

In FY 2024, we processed over 469,000 remittances and collected over $94 million through Pay.gov; we processed approximately 195,000 remittances and collected over $56 million through the lockbox service; and we processed over 49,000 remittances and collected over $5 million through the OLBP.

"OPM","exs1","[exs1] Provide an executive summary of the payment integrity activities and results for the agency for this reporting period (SEE - 'Helpful Hint' - minimum length requirements vary depending on Agency status). (Unit - Free-Text)","OPM is committed to advancing a transparent, accountable, and collaborative financial management environment to fulfill its federal requirements and provide stakeholders with accessible and actionable
financial information. An essential part of this commitment is the continuous improvement of payment accuracy in OPM’s programs and robust internal controls. OPM continues to implement solutions to
prevent, detect, and reduce improper payments while reducing its stakeholders’ unnecessary administrative burden.

OPM's Inspector General concluded that the agency was non-compliant with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) in the most recent compliance audit.

PIIA requires the agency to review and assess all programs and activities with annual outlays greater than $10,000,000 for improper payment risk at least once every three years to identify those susceptible to significant improper payments. OPM conducts improper payment risk assessments on a three-year cycle, or more often if there are significant changes in the program. In FY 2023 OPM conducted improper payments risk assessments for four programs.  All programs analyzed this FY remained Phase I programs.  OPM continues to only have two Phase II programs; Retirement Services and Federal Employee Health Benefits Experience Rated Carriers.

OPM's Retirement Services improper and unknown rate is 0.33 percent. The improper payment rate is 0.32 percent. The tolerable rate is 0.38 percent. RS is aware of the improper payment drivers; however, systemic limitations prevent RS from providing the survey's requested level of specificity. OPM’s systems were not designed or built to perform analyses of vast quantities of data. There are overpayments that are
the result of annuitant's family members and other sources failing to report annuitant's death. However, as our on-going internal control activities, OPM conducts surveys and matches to mitigate potential improper payments resulting from these events. OPM conducts two matches to identify discrepancies that may exist between the OPM annuity roll and the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) pay system. The Consolidated Death Match (CDM) is compared with OPM’s annuity roll weekly to identify annuitants who are reported as deceased by SSA. The Validated Agency Match System processes the death information in order to terminate Federal benefits and prevent subsequent improper payments. Collection actions are initiated for any overpayments that are discovered. The SSA Death Master File (DMF) match is conducted yearly and is also compared with OPM’s annuity roll and the SSA Death Master File (DMF). OPM also utilizes Treasury's Do Not Pay Portal to identify annuitants that should have been reported as deceased.

In the FY 2023 annual compliance audit, OPM OIG found that OPM’s FEHB Program was not in compliance with four of the ten PIIA reporting requirements:  
1)	Published improper payment and unknown payment estimates for programs susceptible to significant improper payments and unknown payments in the accompanying materials to the annual financial statement.
2)	Published corrective action plans for each program for which an estimate above the statutory threshold was published in the accompanying materials to the annual financial statement.
3)	Demonstrated improvements to payment integrity or reached a tolerable improper payment and unknown payment rate.
4)	Reported an improper payment and unknown payment estimate of less than 10 percent for each program for which an estimate was published in the accompanying materials to the annual financial statement.
OPM is expeditiously implementing the actions needed for OPM to be compliant with PIIA reporting.  In FY 2022, OPM’s OCFO/Risk Management and Internal Controls (RMIC) office performed a risk assessment of the FEHB Program.  That risk assessment determined the FEHB Program was susceptible to significant improper payments, thus requiring OPM to report an IP estimate in FY 2023.  OPM immediately started developing a new improper payment methodology.  While developing the new methodology, OPM determined that the FEHB Program should be differentiated into two activities for OMB reporting purposes. The FEHB Program has different contracts, payment structures, and improper payment types for the Experience-Rated Carriers and Community Rated Carriers, meriting meaningfully different sampling and estimation methodology plans.  Off-cycle risk assessments were conducted for both new activities, with only the FEHB Experience-Rated Carriers determined susceptible to significant improper payments.  As the Community-Rated Carriers activity was not determined to be susceptible to significant improper payments, OPM is not required to report an improper and unknown payment estimate.

OPM developed a new improper payment methodology in FY 2023 and actively engaged with agency stakeholders and FEHB Carriers to meet the PIIA requirements.   In FY 2024, OPM issued Carrier Letter 2024-15 Guidance on Audited Financial Statements for Federal Fiscal Year 2024. This Carrier Letter included the 2024 FEHBP Financial Reporting and Audit Guide, which provides detailed requirements for the financial reporting for all FEHB Experience-Rated carriers, including audit requirements and improper payment reporting. In FY 2024, OPM conducted training on the Financial Reporting and Audit Guide for all Experience-Rated Carriers and their Independent Public Accountants. OPM requires time to implement the new improper payment methodology, as the FEHB Experience-Rated Carriers need time to collect, audit, and report their data back to OPM. OPM anticipates being in compliance with PIIA in FY 2025.

In addition to internal controls OPM uses and will continue to use training and audits to address improper payment issues.","2024"

The guidance requires agencies to assess every Federal program with annual outlays greater than $10 million dollars, at least triennially, for improper payment risk, measure the accuracy of payments annually, and initiate program improvements to ensure payment integrity. On November 20, 2009, Executive Order 13520, Reducing Improper Payments and Eliminating Waste in Federal Programs, was issued for the purpose of intensifying efforts to eliminate payment error, waste, fraud, and abuse in the major programs administered by the Federal government, while continuing to ensure that the right people receive the right payment for the right reason at the right time. The supporting website, https://paymentaccuracy.gov/, contains the following information:

•	Current and historical rates and amounts of improper payments for Federal agencies;
•	Why improper payments occur; and
•	What agencies are doing to reduce and recover improper payments.
Program Review
The STB has only one program for budget purposes. The FY 2024 appropriated funding for the program is $47.452 million. All the agency’s transactions are either employee payroll and benefits, intra-governmental, or non-Federal transactions.

The STB does not maintain its own financial management system but uses a shared service provider, ESC, to process all accounting transactions and the DOI processes payroll and benefits. ESC is subject to external audit in accordance with the Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) 18, Attestation Standards: Clarification and Recodification. The STB examines the SSAE No. 18 audit results annually to determine if the shared service provider’s internal controls are operating effectively. The Board also evaluates the internal controls required to supplement the shared service provider’s controls as outlined in the SSAE 18.

Intra-governmental transactions, accounts payables, and payments to agency employees are reviewed as part of the agency’s internal control program under OMB Circular A-123, Appendix A, Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Appendix C, Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement.

Based on OMB Circular A-123, the STB’s program was reviewed to identify those activities that were susceptible to significant improper payments. For FY 2024, the STB Federal and non-Federal payment was $16 million, and payroll was $28.1 million for a combined total of
 
$44.1 million. The Payment Integrity Information Act defines “significant” as either (1) improper payments that exceed both $10 million and 1.5% of program disbursements; or (2) improper payments in excess of $100 million. Significant improper payments in the STB’s program needed to exceed both $0.6 million (1.5% improper payment rate) and $10 million of all non-Federal payments and payments to Federal employees. No material improper payments were identified by the STB in FY 2024 for significant improper payment reporting.
In addition, the following risk factors, likely to contribute to improper payments, were applied to the STB’s appropriated funds.
1.	Any new programs or activity in the agency.
2.	Complexity of the activity with respect to correct payments amounts.

Improper Payments Strategy
The Payment Integrity Information Act requires agencies to conduct payment recapture audits with respect to each program and activity of the agency with expenditures of $1 million or more annually, if conducting such audits would be cost-effective. The STB addresses proper management of payments by:
•	preventing payment errors through documented processes and internal controls;
•	detecting overpayment and underpayments through control testing.
Due to the STB’s limited staffing levels for its accounting and financial reporting functions, such support services are provided under contract with ESC. Coordinating with ESC has greatly enhanced the STB's capabilities for identification of improper payments using detailed internal controls at both the STB and ESC. The STB obtains contracting support from DOT, which follows established pre-enrollment, pre-award, and pre-payment processes for all acquisition awards. Pre-enrollment procedures include cross referencing applicants against the GSA System for Award Management (SAM) exclusion records. ESC reviews Federal and commercial databases to verify past performance, Federal government debt, integrity, and business ethics. For prepayment processes, ESC verifies an entity against both SAM and the
 
Internal Revenue Service’s Taxpayer Identification Number Match Program before establishing the entity as a vendor in its core financial accounting system.
Recapture of Improper Payments Reporting
The Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 requires agencies to conduct recovery audits with respect to each program and activity of the agency that expends $1 million or more annually, if conducting such audits would be cost-effective.
Once the STB has identified an improper payment with a non-Federal vendor, it is STB’s policy to aggressively correct the improper payment. Upon research and analysis of supporting documentation, the vendor is contacted for resolution (in the case of underpayment to the agency). If the contract is ongoing, the Board will offset the amount to be recovered on the next billing. For all other contracts, the vendor is contacted, and a receivable is established for collection. If the vendor does not provide payment, the debt is entered into the Treasury Offset Program. If an improper payment is identified as an overpayment to the STB, the vendor is promptly paid.
The table below shows the result of improper payments (in millions of dollars) identified during FY 2024.

(Unit- Free-Text)","Our fiscal year (FY) 2024 improper payment risk assessment of FY 2023 administrative payments included a review of Payroll and Benefits, State Disability Determination Services (DDS), and Other Administrative Expenses.  We will not have all FY 2024 data until January 2025.

Payroll and benefits account for a majority of our total administrative expenses.  For FY 2023, we found approximately $3.35 million in improper payroll overpayments out of $7,925 million payroll payments, which yielded a 0.04 percent improper overpayment rate.

For State DDS payments, our 10 regional offices review amounts drawn against pre-approved DDS spending plans.  For payment accuracy, our Office of the Inspector General reviews the DDS payments on a rotational basis.  We use our Inspector General’s findings, if any, to enhance our payment controls.

From the Other Administrative Expenses category, we review vendor and employee travel payments using an existing internal recovery activities program with tools to aid in the detection and recovery of improper overpayments, including:  an automated query system to identify duplicate payments made to the same vendor, with the same invoice date, and for the same amount; an annual payment accuracy review examining select criteria on a random sample of payments to identify IPs or a weakness in the internal payment recapture audit program; and a risk assessment of administrative payment systems and recovery of any overpayments identified in this process.

We identified total FY 2023 vendor and travel improper overpayments of $0.92 million, approximately 0.05 percent of total payments subject to review.

As part of our review of Other Administrative Expenses, we reviewed our Inspector General (IG) report, Fiscal Year 2023 Periodic Assessment of the Social Security Administration’s Charge Card Programs, which was published in April 2024.  OIG stated the following regarding the results of the assessment:  “We determined the risk of illegal, improper, and erroneous purchases made through SSA’s charge card programs is low.  SSA implemented safeguards and internal controls to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse of purchase cards, travel cards, and CBAs by designing its policies and procedures to address the requirements in the Act and OMB Circular A-123, Appendix B.”

In addition, in May 2020, we performed administrative fraud risk assessments to actively measure the effectiveness of the internal controls over the processing of grants, large contracts, and travel and purchase cards.  These FY 2020 assessments found that our management-related risks for these administrative payments fall well below the OMB threshold.  In FY 2024, we conducted a maintenance assessment in the administrative fraud program areas consistent with Government Accountability Office guidance.

We also leveraged the results of an independent accounting firm’s FY 2018 residual risk assessment in support of our FMFIA Internal Control Program.  This assessment found that our administrative expenses, accounts payables, human resources, and payroll management-related residual risks are low overall.  Testing over the years, including our FY 2024 internal testing of controls in those areas confirmed that the residual risk remains low.

Results from our comprehensive recovery activities program and quality review process confirm that our administrative payments are well below the Office of Management and Budget threshold for reporting IPs.

The team works with key agency stakeholders to develop Improper Payment Alignment Strategies that outline innovative and effective strategies to mitigate the root causes of improper payments.  We also reestablished the Deputy-Commissioner level Improper Payments Oversight Board (IPOB), which is responsible for reviewing, approving, and implementing all improper payment initiatives.

Payments reviewed for IPs, which includes all payments screened by the DNP Initiative or other USAID internal databases managed by USAID’s OCFO as appropriate, and disbursed by, or on behalf of USAID; 
Payments stopped, which includes payments intercepted or not disbursed because of the DNP Initiative; and 
IPs reviewed and not stopped, which includes payments reviewed by the DNP databases, disbursed, and later identified as improper. 


USAID’s OCFO plans to continue using the portal to adjudicate any DNP matches. However, USAID would like to note that the DNP Initiative is an automated portal designed to identify beneficiary matches for entitlements, which the Agency does not disburse. 

Since FY 2015, USAID has reviewed  518,847 payments that totaled $104.4  billion, using the DNP Initiative to conclude no confirmed improper payments.

"SSA","CAP5","[CAP5]Provide 6-10 sentences summarizing the conclusions and recommendation(s) provided by the OIG for each non-compliant criterion AND the actions and measurable milestones the program has planned to bring each program into compliance with each non-compliant criterion. (Unit - Free-Text) ","The most recent Office of the Inspector General (OIG) Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) annual compliance audit was for fiscal year (FY) 2023.  In FY 2023, we had two programs reporting estimates above the statutory threshold, our Old-Age and Survivors, Disability Insurance (OASDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs.  In the FY 2023 compliance audit, the Social Security OIG concluded the agency was compliant with nine PIIA reporting requirements, but we did not comply with one PIIA reporting requirement to demonstrate improvements to payment integrity or reach a tolerable improper payment and unknown payment rate for the OASDI and SSI programs.  The FY 2023 compliance audit report stated, “While SSA has made progress implementing corrective actions to address improper payments, it still has work to do.”  The FY 2023 compliance audit report included the following recommendation, “We recommend SSA finalize the IP [improper payments] alignment strategy for OASDI computations overpayment deficiency dollars.”

We implemented the Improper Payments Alignment Strategies (IPAS) to focus on our corrective actions to address the root causes of improper payments in both the OASDI and SSI programs.  As part of our IPAS, we identify the root causes and evaluate the effectiveness of each completed mitigation initiative.  Additionally, we determine the most cost-effective strategies to remediate the underlying causes of payment errors and monitor, measure, and revise the strategies as needed.  IPAS is the process that we use to obtain agency wide engagement and agreement on actions needed to remedy improper payment issues.  In FY 2025, we will complete the IPAS for OASDI computations and draft a new IPAS on relationship.

OASDI overpayments within the agency’s control are due to our failure to access data or information needed.  These overpayments occur when the beneficiary or third-party provided data or information that we requested and was necessary to accurately compute the benefit amount, but we failed to use the data or information needed to validate the payment accuracy prior to making a payment.  To prevent these overpayments from occurring, technicians follow existing procedures, and we provide training and reminders for technicians when applicable and automation solutions to improve accuracy when possible.  We will continue to improve technician tools and processes and strengthen our training to better equip our workforce.

OASDI overpayments outside of the agency’s control occur when we are unable to access data needed to validate payment accuracy because the beneficiary or a third-party either did not provide requested information or provided inaccurate information necessary to compute the accurate benefit amount.  The primary cause of these overpayments is our reliance on timely self-reporting of wage and employment.  To reduce our reliance on timely self-reporting of wage and employment information, we plan to utilize a new wage reporting option where we receive wage and employment information from payroll data providers through an automated payroll information exchange (PIE), which we discuss later in this response.  Overall, we continue to have a high payment accuracy rate.

For the SSI program, of the estimated $5.6 billion in SSI overpayments, approximately $5.3 billion was due to factors outside of the agency’s control because the data or information to validate payment accuracy prior to making payment does not exist or is inaccessible to us.  Failure to report changes is the primary cause of both overpayments and underpayments.  We will continue to improve notices to make it easier to understand.  As of September 30, 2024, as part of the SSI regulation simplification in-kind and maintenance updates, we removed a significant burden to report receipt of food assistance and reduced reporting burdens for individuals living in public assistance households.  Additionally, the expansion of the rental subsidy may increase the benefit amount some people are eligible to receive and will allow more people to qualify for critical SSI payments.

Additionally, to help mitigate OASDI and SSI improper payments related to wages, we developed a new wage reporting option where we receive wage and employment information from a payroll data provider through an automated PIE.  In February 2024, we published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking describing the agency’s plans for accessing and using information from payroll data providers to reduce improper payments (overpayments and underpayments), which improves service to customers.  The public comment period closed on April 15, 2024.  We are carefully considering the comments as we draft the final rule, which is currently planned for publication in winter of FY 2025.  In FY 2024, we completed the automated PIE wage reporting notices and created a limited issue diary to alert technicians when incoming wage and employment information from PIE doesn't automatically post to the SSI record, requiring manual review and action.  We plan to implement PIE in Spring 2025 through a phased approach after a final rule is published.  We continue to work on training, marketing, designing a phased approach, and updating policy in preparation for implementation.

The RRB notified OMB of our approach in August 2011.  The agency is diligent in its recovery efforts for overpayments.  The agency conducts numerous quality assurance reviews focused on detecting improper payments in the vendor and employee payment programs.  The reviews constitute a robust monitoring program for improper payments and consistently return a zero percent error rate.  The most recent Fiscal Years (2022 and 2023) results concluded that there was no indication of improper payments.  In addition, we perform a bi-weekly review of payroll which includes a HR Links report of hours certified by surpervisors and a General Services Administration's report which identifies the payroll amount for the same period.  A comparison of the two reports is completed to verify that the two totals reconcile.  Based on the comparisons, results have not returned any indication of improper payments related to payroll.  Thus, no recapture audit program or alternative method for vendor and employee payments would be deemed cost effective as current management controls are proving effective.  Taken as a whole, our full range of current activities constitutes an effective alternative to a formal payment recapture program.  However, despite the agency's best efforts to prevent improper payments, some will always occur due to lack of timely information, etc.","2024"

"TREASURY","CAP5","[CAP5]Provide 6-10 sentences summarizing the conclusions and recommendation(s) provided by the OIG for each non-compliant criterion AND the actions and measurable milestones the program has planned to bring each program into compliance with each non-compliant criterion. (Unit - Free-Text) ","Treasury was not in compliance with PIIA for FY 2023 due to Treasury not adequately concluding whether the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) and Pandemic Relief for Aviation Workers, also known as the Payroll Support Program (PSP), pandemic relief programs are likely to make IPs and UPs above or below the statutory threshold.

The OIG recommendation was Treasury's Risk and Control Group (RCG) should work with the Office of Capital Access (OCA) management to consider all information available when answering risk assessment questions to ensure adequate completion and conclusion of susceptibility for these program-specific risk assessments.

The following are the actions and measurable milestones these programs have planned for this non-compliance criteria: OCA conducted a new risk assessment for FY24 for ERA. The risk assessments reconsidered previous answers and took into account factors beyond the four corners of the assessment template. Additionally, OCA has completed additional risk assessment addendums on program recipient and sub-recipients as coordinated by RCG.  OCA did not conduct a new risk assessment for FY24 for PSP, given that the program has wound down and had less than $10 million in outlays during FY23. However, and as noted in a memo sent to ODCFO on 9/17/24, OCA will conduct a payment recapture audit of PSP. OIG audits of PSP recipients have pointed to the inclusion of unallowable employer-side payroll taxes and corporate officer compensation in recipients' sworn financial statements as causes for overpayments.

Treasury was also found non-compliant for not reporting an improper payment error rate of less than 10% for the IRS Earned Income Tax Credit, Additional Child Tax Credit, American Opportunity Tax Credit, and the refundable Premium Assistance Tax Credit. OIG did not provide any recommendations regarding this non-compliant criteria. Refundable tax credit overclaims are not the result of internal control weaknesses that the IRS can remediate internally, but are in fact the result of factors beyond the Agency's control under the current law and existing authority.","2024"

The COO has performance expectations related to payment integrity and financial stewardship incorporated into COO's annual performance plan.					

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) continues significant efforts to bring its payment program to an improper rate of less than 10 percent. The IRS captures metrics related to pre-refund activities and works closely with internal and external partners to expand outreach efforts. Many of these metrics are tied to the pre-refund examination program and IRS's continued approach to improve refundable tax credit audits. The Refund Integrity and Compliance Services (RICS) Director conducts quarterly operational reviews with Refundable Credits Examination Operations (RCEO) and Refundable Credits Program Management (RCPM) on the refundable credits program. The RICS and RCPM Directors and managers have performance plan commitments that address enhancements emphasizing tax return accuracy and reducing improper payments. Proactive actions are being taken to improve the audit response rates and taxpayer's filing behavior for refundable credits to decrease the audit selection volume. The IRS performance plans have a balanced approach which include outreach and compliance. Again, the IRS looks to find ways to enhance the taxpayer experience and improve the knowledge of taxpayers and paid return preparers on the eligibility and criteria for RTCs. Without significant legislative action and restructuring of programs, meeting a target compliance date will be a significant challenge.","2024"

(Unit - Free-Text)","For more than a decade, laws and regulations governing the identification and recovery of improper payments have evolved to strengthen improvements in payment accuracy and raise public confidence in Federal programs. The Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA), as amended and expanded by other related laws, collectively required agencies to periodically review all programs and activities to identify those susceptible to significant improper payments, to conduct payment recapture audits, and to leverage Government-wide Do Not Pay initiatives. The IPIA regulations also required extensive reporting requirements. OMB transformed the improper payment compliance framework to create a more unified, comprehensive, and less burdensome set of requirements. IPIA was repealed and replaced by the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA), which was passed on March 2, 2020. The PIIA modified and restructured existing improper payments laws to help agencies better identify and reduce any money wasted as a result of improper government payments. Not all improper payments are fraud, and not all improper payments represent a loss to the government. Generally, an improper payment is any payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount under a statutory, contractual, and administrative or other legally applicable requirement.

The Department defines its programs and activities in alignment with the manner of funding received through appropriations, as further subdivided into funding for operations carried out around the world. Risk assessments over all programs are done every three years. In the interim years, risk assessments evaluating programs that experience any significant legislative changes and/or significant increase in funding will be done to determine if the Department continues to be at low risk for making significant improper payments at or above the threshold levels set by OMB. The Department conducted a risk assessment of all programs and activities in 2022 and 2024 was the third year of the three-year cycle. In 2024, the programs included: Foreign Locally Employed Staff Compensation; Economic Support Fund; Worldwide Security Protection; International Security Programs; International Cooperative Administrative Support Services; Consular and Border Security Programs; Consular Information Technology and Security; and Peacekeeping Operations Programs. After performing risk assessments for these programs, the Department determined that none of its programs in 2024 were risk-susceptible for making significant improper payments at or above the threshold levels set by OMB.

Annually, the Department submits data to OMB that is collected and presented on the Payment Accuracy website by individual agency or on a Government-wide consolidated basis. This website contains current and historical information about improper payments made under Federal programs, as well as extensive information about how improper payments are defined and tracked. Please refer to the Payment Accuracy website for detailed results from the Department’s efforts in 2024 to comply with PIIA.

(Unit- Free-Text)","The Department of State reviewed potential improper payments provided by the Department of the Treasury as a result of submitting disbursed payments through the Do Not Pay (DNP) portal. In 2024, the Treasury reviewed and disbursed 1,531,627 payments totaling $17.2 billion paid by the Department through the DNP portal. Potential matches were provided on a daily basis, comparing payments to the public Death Master File (DMF) of the Social Security Administration and the General Services Administration’s Excluded Parties List System (EPLS). Through daily access via the Treasury DNP portal, the Department reviewed 190,340 unmatchable payments, totaling $1.9 billion, and adjudicated 110 potential erroneous payment matches as part of the post payment review process. 

The Department continued to utilize the DNP portal’s DMF on a pre-payment basis for all annuitant payments. At least twice each month the Department’s annuitant database is screened against the DMF to identify deceased annuitants. All matches are researched and if confirmed, payment to the annuitant is stopped prior to processing the monthly annuity payment run. In 2024, there were 205,354 annuitant payments totaling $1.2 billion were reviewed against the DMF and 248 payments totaling $6.5 million were stopped due to this initiative. This process is successful in identifying deceased annuitants and ensuring improper payments are not made. In addition, all annuity manual payments processed through Treasury’s Secure Payment System are reviewed through the DMF online search prior to making payment. 

For non-Treasury Disbursing Office oversees payments, payee information is checked against Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control’s (OFAC) list of Specially Designated Nationals (SDN). During 2024, there were 2,658,190 payments totaling $10.3 billion of potential payment matches reviewed resulting in no stopped payments.

In addition, Department grants processed through the Health and Human Service (HHS) Payment Management System (PMS) are included in a DNP review. HHS incorporated a review of the DNP portal into their payment process to identify individuals or entities with delinquent Federal non-tax debt, a recipient that is listed as deceased on the DMF, and recipients excluded from doing business with the government. In 2024, the Department was notified of no recipient that appeared ineligible due to results of the DNP process. In addition, in 2024, seven recipient payments were stopped as a result of the Treasury Offset Program (TOP). The TOP is a centralized offset program, administered by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s Debt Management Services, to collect delinquent debts owed to the Federal agencies and states (including past-due child support), in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 6402(d) (collection of debts owed to Federal agencies), 31 U.S.C. 3720A (reduction of tax refund by amount of the debts), and other applicable laws.

Annually, USAGM conducts improper payment risk assessments of all programs on a three-year rotational schedule for the period.  In FY 2024, USAGM conducted improper payment risk assessments for three programs and determined they were not susceptible to significant improper payments.  Additionally, risk assessments will be for programs that undergo significant legislative changes or substantial increases in funding, to determine if the agency remains at low risk for making improper payments at or above the threshold levels established by PIIA.  Finally, USAGM maintains payment integrity through strong prepayment controls and continuous monitoring.

Although the SBA was found to be non-compliant with the Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) by the OIG in their FY 2024 PIIA Compliance Audit, the SBA continues to make payment integrity efforts and reducing improper payments a priority. The SBA has already implemented several corrective actions to address the OIG recommendations and are continuing our efforts to implement additional corrective action plans to address the remaining open OIG recommendations with an anticipated closure date of September 2025 for all OIG recommendations identified during the FY 2024 PIIA Compliance audit.
To further address risks related to improper payments, the SBA performs qualitative risk assessments on programs not reporting improper payment estimates to identify programs susceptible to significant improper payments. The SBA's risk assessments are performed on a 3-year rotational basis with our last round of risk assessments completed in FY 2022. In FY 2024, the SBA conducted two qualitative risk assessments, the Growth Accelerator Fund program and the Section 1112 payments.  Through our risk assessment process, it was concluded that the Growth Accelerator Fund program was not susceptible to significant improper payments, and the Section 1112 payments were susceptible to significant improper payments.
On an annual basis, the SBA monitors programmatic activities by reviewing the outlays data for each SBA program to identify programs that had significant changes in outlays and/or programs that are now in Phase 1. In FY 2024, a total of seven programs are in Phase 2. Of the seven programs reporting in Phase 2, four programs are major credit programs mandated by OMB, and three programs are programs that were created as a result of the pandemic response.

We have no plans to conduct payment recapture audits or contract for a private sector payment recapture auditing firm because of the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs’ complexity.  We conducted extensive market research prior to deciding not to use external auditors.  We put out a Request for Information and received approximately 15 responses.  We interviewed all of the respondents, who agreed that they could not match our benefit payments internal controls and audit mechanisms because of the complexity of our programs.  The typical claims specialist (our principal benefits reviewer, authorizer and adjudicator position) receives an average of 13 weeks of training prior to entering the job and does not achieve journeyman status until they have been on the job for 2 years.

We have a comprehensive debt collection program.  We collected $4.9 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2024 at an administrative cost of $0.08 on average per dollar collected.  To recover overpayments, we use internal debt collection techniques (i.e., payment withholding, billing, and follow up), as well as some external collection techniques authorized by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 for OASDI debts and the Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 for SSI debts.

We developed a system to use the Treasury Offset Program (TOP), credit bureau reporting, and Administrative Wage Garnishment collection mechanisms for delinquent debts.  Because the system includes more than TOP and is the basis for any future collection interfaces with outside agencies or entities, we call it the External Collection Operation system.

The Federal Government uses the reclamation process to recover benefit payments paid via direct deposit to the financial account of a beneficiary who died and is not entitled to the payment, became legally incapacitated, or who died before the date of the payment(s).  To recover OASDI and SSI payments from U.S. financial institutions, we must send reclamation requests within 120 days of the date we have actual or constructive knowledge of a beneficiary’s death or legal incapacity.  A financial institution may protest a recovery of funds if we did not initiate the reclamation timely.

For Administrative Payments, our current recovery activities program is a proven cost-effective means for evaluating payment accuracy and identifying improper payments.  In 2013, we contracted with a private sector recovery auditing firm on a contingency fee basis to review our administrative payments.  The firm based its review on past industry experience of improper payment rates, and a cost/benefit analysis of transactions processed by type and dollars paid.  Because of their minimal recovery, the auditors terminated the contract.

(Unit - Free-Text)","Fiscal Service management has determined that conducting recovery audits for its programs would not be cost effective. Fiscal Service makes payments based on the public law, adjudications, or payment certification from Federal Agencies. Although, a formal recovery audit is not performed, internal reviews are conducted before all payments are made. A justification was submitted to OMB in 2018 to request exemption for reporting recovery audits for this fund group.* Per OMB's letter to Treasury Assistant Secretary for Management, dated March 20, 2014, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) custodial/bond programs are exempt from Payment Recapture Auditing. Treasury considers these payments negative revenue receipts, not outlays, and thereby exempt them from improper payment requirements. OMB agreed that this is a reasonable approach, however these custodial/bond programs are still required to conduct risk assessments. IRS submitted a justification to OMB in 2016 to exempt its non-custodial/bond programs from recovery auditing. The five-year average cost of recovery auditing far exceeded the average improper payments identified. No improper payments were recaptured through recovery auditing; all funds recaptured were identified through normal operating processes and collected through established procedures. Pre-payment reviews are conducted for the purposes of preventing, identifying, and recovering improper payments for contracts, modifications, and task orders. For its fund groups relating to the COVID-19 pandemic relief programs, including the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, IRS provided a justification for determination that recovery auditing is not cost effective in FY 2023. Current business practices (e.g., audit reports, self-reported overpayments, statistical samples conducted under PIIA) provide an efficient and effective means for identification of overpayments. The IRS's robust information technology platform includes several filters to monitor the accuracy of eligibility rules and payment certification for the various tax credits.* The Office of International Assistance provided a cost-effective justification to OMB for recovery auditing in 2018. Payments for this fund group can be in two forms: payment vouchers on letter of credit which are administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and direct cash payments via the Secure Payment System. Internal reviews are performed before all payments are made. Management has determined that it would not be cost-effective to perform formal recovery auditing on this fund group. * The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) submitted a cost-effective justification for recovery auditing to OMB in 2018. The justification was based on the following: The OCCs improper payment risk assessment for the five categories of payments (contract payments, invoices, travel card, purchase card, payroll and benefits) has resulted in a low-risk rating since at least FY 2012. The OCC has strong internal controls over payments as validated by A-123 testing. The OCC conducts ongoing internal reviews of travel vouchers, purchase cards, and other transactions. The OCC performs an annual review of contract payments using analytic techniques to identify potentially fraudulent activity or other payment anomalies. The OCC has very low delinquency and unauthorized use rates for government travel and purchase cards and for expenditures of OCC funds outside of prescribed policies and procedures. The most recent payment recapture audit activities required a higher cost in employee resources than the amount recovered. * The Treasury Franchise Fund submitted a cost-effective justification to OMB in 2018. The qualitative risk assessments for this fund group have been low risk since 2013. Prior fiscal year recovery audits before the justification was established yielded .01% of disbursements for this fund group. This fund group conducts pre-payment and post-payment reviews. Because of these reasons, management determined it would not be cost-effective to conduct recovery audits on this fund group. * The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) submitted a cost-effective justification for recovery auditing to OMB in 2019. The basis of the justification was that BEP's risk assessments are consistently low risk for improper payments. Prior fiscal years found that the improper payment dollar amount for BEP equates to .004% of the total disbursements for the program. BEP continues to do pre-payment and post-payment reviews. * Treasury’s Coronavirus Economic Relief for Transportation Services (CERTS) program identified one instance of overpayment, and one instance of ineligibility, both of which were 100% recaptured, and represented less than 0.1% of the total program awards. As of August 2022, the CERTS program had completed all its awards to recipients and shifted to the recipient monitoring phase of the program. Since there was a low prevalence of overpayments and payments to ineligible recipients, and a 100% recapture rate, the cost of performing a recapture audit would outweigh any potential benefit. * Treasury’s Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund (SLFRF) identified three overpayments, which were 100% recaptured, and represented less than 1.0% of the total program awards. In each of these three cases, recipients notified Treasury of the overpayments and were provided instructions on how to return funds to Treasury. Since the program has implemented multiple levels of control activities to enhance the frequency and quality of payment integrity reviews, the risk of improper payments is low. Therefore, the cost of performing a payment recapture audit would outweigh any potential benefit. * Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) consulted, during the application phase, with the primary federal regulators for each applicant (being a regulated financial institution) to confirm that it was eligible to receive funding. The underwriting process was conducted in coordination with teams of community development finance and financial institutions and external financial advisers. ECIP program management was required to approve each investment decision, based on established procedures which incorporated risk management controls and included multiple layers of review. Since the program has implemented multiple levels of review involving multiple outside and independent assessments, the risk of improper payments is low and the potential benefit of conducting a separate payment recapture audit is minimal and would be duplicative. * Treasury’s Local Assistance and Tribal Consistency Fund (LATCF) has maintained its own listing and database of eligible primary recipients, and therefore, the eligibility risk of primary recipients is essentially zero. Since LATCF has multiple levels of internal/quality controls to enhance the frequency and quality of the payment integrity review, the risk of improper payments is low. * Treasury’s State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) program team relies on a vigorous SSBCI application review process and conducts post-approval procedures through SSBCI's  Compliance Program. The application process includes checks to validate identity, confirm eligibility, and ensure accurate inputs for the payment (grant sizing) formula, as well as verify that the applicant is not on exclusion lists (including the Do Not Pay Portal) dedicated to preventing improper payments.  * For the Capital Projects Fund (CPF), Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA), and Homeowners Assistance Fund (HAF), Treasury has implemented multiple levels of control activities including: (1) reviews of single audit reports which facilitates the identification and prevention of costs that may ultimately result in improper payments if not remedied;  and (2) a standardized, cross-program compliance program that includes established compliance testing procedures as well as recipient self-identified reporting, through which improper payments are identified and documented in accordance with non-compliance remediation procedures and remediation action taken. * The Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR) has an established inter-agency agreement and service level agreement in place with the Treasury's Administrative Resource Center (ARC) Financial Services program for providing financial support services. As it relates specifically to recovery processes this includes but is not limited to activities such as performing funds control reviews and maintenance on a weekly basis and review recovery analysis. ARC has processes in place for financial reporting and reconciliations on a routine basis to identify, prevent and/or recover improper payments based on established thresholds. SIGPR has also developed and implemented policies and procedures to ensure controls over payments are implemented, including daily financial reporting and reconciliations to identify, to prevent and/or recover improper payments based on established thresholds. Since there are payment recovery processes included within the policies and multiple levels of review involving multiple outside and independent assessments, the risks of improper payments are low and the potential benefit of conducting a separate payment recapture audit is minimal and would be duplicative.  Therefore, the cost of performing a payment recapture audit would outweigh any potential benefit. * The Treasury Executive Office of Asset Forfeiture (TEOAF) has analyzed several factors and reviewed several current procedures for the Treasury Forfeiture Fund to determine if implementation of payment recapture auditing is cost effective These include: a low risk assessment determination, EOAF staff reviews monthly payments for accuracy, obligations are established at a very low detail levels to provide easier control and review of payment activity, the nature of the program payments being made to state and local law enforcement agencies minimizes improper payments, and improper payment review yielded no improper payment issues. Therefore, EOAF has determined the additional cost for staff and resources to conduct payment recapture audits would not be cost effective. * The Office of DC Pensions’ (ODCP) largest payment area is benefits and has a robust multi-tier quality review program that includes in-depth annuitant case review as a part of its normal course of business. Through ODCP's quality review program, significant numbers of annuitant cases are reviewed monthly and when errors are detected, benefit payments are corrected and debt collection activities begin, as applicable. In addition, all contract payments and Federal Employee Payments include a second level review prior to payment submission.  As such, ODCP had determined that a payment recapture audit is not cost effective as it is very unlikely that any additional overpayments would be identified, i.e., the cost would exceed the benefit.","2024"

(Unit- Free-Text)","USAGM made a change to our Improper Payment methodology for the FY 24 reporting period.  In prior years, USAGM's risk assessment methodology included a comprehensive quantitative risk assessment of 145 sampled payments per program on a three-year rotational cycle of all agency programs with annual outlays of $10M or more during the assessment cycle.  USAGM uses an alternative assessment cycle from Quarter 4 of the prior fiscal year through Quarter 3 of the current fiscal year. 

USAGM conducted an analysis of identified improper payments from sampling testing between FY20 and FY23, showing consistently low error rates. The quarterly self-reported data on improper payments ranged from about 2% to 4% annually, primarily linked to payroll deductions (reviewed through self-reported program review).

Given the low rates in previous years, USAGM reduced testing to forty samples per year for each entity as part of a three-year risk assessment cycle, in line with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019. We will continue to implement thorough controls for self-reporting and program reviews, demonstrating a commitment to strengthening oversight and ensuring compliance with regulations to minimize the risk of improper payments.","2024"

"SSA","exs1","[exs1] Provide an executive summary of the payment integrity activities and results for the agency for this reporting period (SEE - 'Helpful Hint' - minimum length requirements vary depending on Agency status). (Unit - Free-Text)","The most recent Office of the Inspector General (OIG) Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) annual compliance audit was for fiscal year (FY) 2023.  In FY 2023, we had two programs reporting estimates above the statutory threshold, our Old-Age and Survivors, Disability Insurance (OASDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs.  In the FY 2023 compliance audit, the Social Security OIG concluded the agency was compliant with nine PIIA reporting requirements, but we did not comply with one PIIA reporting requirement to demonstrate improvements to payment integrity or reach a tolerable improper payment and unknown payment rate for the OASDI and SSI programs.  The FY 2023 compliance audit report stated, “While SSA has made progress implementing corrective actions to address improper payments, it still has work to do.”  The FY 2023 compliance audit report included the following recommendation, “We recommend SSA finalize the IP [improper payments] alignment strategy for OASDI computations overpayment deficiency dollars.”

The reporting period for this data call reflects FY 2024, and whether the agency is compliant will be determined in calendar year 2025.  PIIA requires agencies to review and assess all programs with annual outlays greater than $10,000,000 for improper payment risk at least once every three years to identify those susceptible to significant improper payments.  Programs that are not likely to have an annual amount of improper payments plus annual unknown payments above the statutory threshold (which is either (a) both 1.5 percent of program outlays and $10,000,000 of all program payments made during the fiscal year, or (b) $100,000,000) are in Phase 1.  Per this definition, our Administrative Payments program is in Phase 1.  Our assessment of improper payment risk in our Administrative Payments program in FY 2024 determined that the program is not susceptible to significant improper payments.  We will conduct another improper payment risk assessment of our Administrative Payments program in FY 2027.  If a program in Phase 1 is likely to annually make improper payments and unknown payments above the statutory threshold, then the program will move into Phase 2 the following year.  Once in Phase 2 a program will have a different set of requirements such as reporting an annual improper payment and unknown payment estimate.  Our OASDI and SSI programs are in Phase 2.

Based on our FY 2023 stewardship reviews (FY 2024 stewardship information will be available in summer 2025), we estimate that we paid approximately $1.4 trillion to OASDI beneficiaries.  Of that total, we estimate about $3.3 billion were overpayments, representing approximately 0.24 percent of outlays.  We estimate that underpayments during this same period were $833.4 million, the equivalent of approximately 0.06 percent of outlays.  In the prior year reporting, based on our FY 2022 stewardship reviews, we estimate that we paid approximately $1.3 trillion to OASDI beneficiaries.  Of that total, we estimate about $6.5 billion were overpayments, representing approximately 0.51 percent of outlays.  We estimate that underpayments during this same period were $1.8 billion, the equivalent of approximately 0.14 percent of outlays.  When comparing prior year reporting to this year's reporting, there has been a decrease in estimated overpayments ($6.5 billion to $3.3 billion) and underpayments ($1.8 billion to $833.4 million) in the OASDI program.

OASDI overpayments within the agency’s control are due to our failure to access data or information needed.  These overpayments occur when the beneficiary or third-party provided data or information that we requested and was necessary to accurately compute the benefit amount, but we failed to use the data or information needed to validate the payment accuracy prior to making a payment.  To prevent these overpayments from occurring, technicians follow existing procedures and we provide training and reminders for technicians when applicable and automation solutions to improve accuracy when possible.

OASDI overpayments outside of the agency’s control occur when we are unable to access data needed to validate payment accuracy because the beneficiary or a third-party either did not provide requested information or provided inaccurate information necessary to compute the accurate benefit amount.  The primary cause of these overpayments is our reliance on timely self-reporting of wage and employment information.  From October 2023 through February 2024, we released social media posts on Facebook and Twitter sharing a link to our YouTube video to help beneficiaries learn about the importance of reporting wages and the automated electronic options for wage reporting.   To reduce our reliance on timely self-reporting of wage and employment information, we plan to utilize a new wage reporting option where we receive wage and employment information from payroll data providers through an automated payroll information exchange (PIE), which we discuss later in this response.  Overall, we continue to have a high payment accuracy rate.

Our greatest payment accuracy challenges occur within the SSI program.  SSI is a means-tested program for individuals with limited income and resources who are blind, disabled, or aged.  Administering the SSI program is complicated by the statutory requirement for us to determine SSI eligibility and calculate SSI payments monthly.  We generally make SSI payments on the first day of the month for eligibility in that month.  Many factors impact SSI payment accuracy.  Even if a payment was correct when paid, subsequent changes in that month can affect the payment due, resulting in either an overpayment or underpayment.  Thus, the program requirements sometimes make improper payments inevitable.  Improper payments often occur if recipients (or their representative payees) fail to timely report changes in any of their eligibility factors (e.g., an increase of their resources or a change in their wages).  Failure to report changes is the primary cause of both overpayments and underpayments.

Based on our FY 2023 stewardship reviews (FY 2024 stewardship information will be available in summer 2025), we estimate that we paid approximately $61.0 billion to SSI recipients.  Of that total, we estimate about $5.6 billion were overpayments, representing approximately 9.18 percent of outlays.  We estimate that underpayments during this same period were $877.9 million, the equivalent of approximately 1.44 percent of outlays.  In the prior year reporting, based on our FY 2022 stewardship reviews, we estimate that we paid approximately $57.6 billion to SSI recipients.  Of that total, we estimate about $4.6 billion were overpayments, representing approximately 8.02 percent of outlays.  We estimate that underpayments during this same period were $680.8 million, the equivalent of approximately 1.18 percent of outlays.  When comparing prior year reporting to this year’s reporting, there has been an increase in estimated overpayments ($4.6 billion to $5.6 billion) and underpayments ($680.8 million to $877.9 million) in the SSI program.

Of the estimated $5.6 billion in SSI overpayments, approximately $5.3 billion was due to factors outside of the agency’s control because the data or information to validate payment accuracy prior to making payment does not exist or is inaccessible to us.  The primary cause of these overpayments is reliance on timely self-reporting of financial accounts over the countable resource limit and employment and wage information.  In March 2024, we released a Dear Colleague Letter to advocates reminding them about SSI reporting responsibilities and the importance of ensuring we have current contact information.  In April 2024, we released a blog that explains to SSI recipients the importance of reporting their financial accounts.  The blog provides examples of financial accounts and informs the reader about Achieving a Better Life Experience accounts.  In general, to address the root causes due to factors outside of agency’s control, we conduct quality reviews and cost-effective program integrity work including SSI non-medical redeterminations.  Additionally, to reduce the reliance on self-reporting, we continue to expand and pursue new data exchange partners from government and private sectors.

Additionally, to help mitigate OASDI and SSI improper payments related to wages, we developed a new wage reporting option where we receive wage and employment information from a payroll data provider through an automated PIE.  In February 2024, we published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking describing the agency’s plans for accessing and using information from payroll data providers to reduce improper payments (overpayments and underpayments), which improves service to customers.  The public comment period closed on April 15, 2024.  We are carefully considering the comments as we draft the final rule, which is currently planned for publication in winter of FY 2025.  In FY 2024, we completed the automated PIE wage reporting notices and created a limited issue diary to alert technicians when incoming wage and employment information from PIE doesn't automatically post to the SSI record, requiring manual review and action.  We plan to implement PIE in Spring 2025 through a phased approach after a final rule is published.  We continue to work on training, marketing, designing a phased approach, and updating policy in preparation for implementation.

Approximately $346.7 million in SSI overpayments were within the agency’s control and due to our failure to access data or information to validate payment accuracy prior to making a payment.  The primary causes of these overpayments are incorrectly computing the payment or failure to obtain or act on available information affecting the payment.  We are addressing this root cause by investing in information technology modernization to provide our employees with user-friendly systems and tools.  To meet the challenges of our growing workloads and provide the best service possible, we are streamlining our policies and procedures, issuing reminders to technicians, and automating more of our business processes.

We implemented the Improper Payments Alignment Strategies (IPAS) to focus on our corrective actions to address the root causes of improper payments in both the OASDI and SSI programs.  As part of our IPAS, we evaluate the effectiveness of each completed mitigation initiative.  Additionally, we determine the most cost-effective strategies to remediate the underlying causes of payment errors and monitor, measure, and revise the strategies as needed.  In FY 2024, we completed the evaluation of completed actions on financial accounts and in-kind support and maintenance.  In FY 2025, we will draft a new IPAS on relationship and OASDI computations.

(Unit- Free-Text)","The Bureau of the Comptroller and Global Financial Services (CGFS) has a two-tiered improper payment monitoring and review program that consists of activities performed by the payment issuing office and secondly by the Office of Management Analysis (MA). The subsequent review performed by MA focuses on overpayments and utilizes data and risk analysis to drive the recapture work performed. While many agencies hire external recapture auditors to perform a secondary review, this function is performed more efficiently within the Department by MA. Because the MA activity is secondary and consistent with a function that an external auditor would perform, MA’s activity is considered recapture as defined by PIIA.

Domestic vendor payments represent the largest category of Department-made payments subject to PIIA recapture audit requirements. MA utilizes several processes that focus on identifying potential improper and duplicate payments. Monthly, as part of the Recapture Audit process, MA conducts a query of domestic vendor payments using software to run matches of vendor invoice numbers and payment amounts against current payment data and payments from the last 5 years. The CGFS automated duplicate payment program using the domestic payment file for recapture audit analysis has proven to be a cost-effective tool.

In addition to the automated IDEA analysis, MA performs a manual quarterly review of overseas and domestic vendor payments. These manual recapture audits validate elements such as vendor, payment amount, receipt of goods or services, and ensure proper documentation exists to support sampled payments. However, in 2024, MA vendor recapture audit efforts identified $23 in overpayments, and only $12 was recovered and returned to the originating appropriation. MA also performs a quarterly manual recapture audit of employee claim payments subject to the Department’s overall travel program. This recapture audit focuses on known identified issue areas as well as providing overall audit coverage of employee travel payments.

During 2024, MA built on prior year recapture audit activities by targeting additional payment aspects to ensure all document types are eligible for review. In addition, MA reviewed grant payments within the universe of the domestic and overseas payment program. The additional inclusion of automated and manual recapture audit processes ensures the Department has coverage in required PIIA recapture audit areas.

(Unit - Free-Text)","Treasury programs in phase 1 are required to complete a PIIA risk assessment once every three years. The years in between risk assessments, we require programs to complete a certification which states there has been no major changes to program funding or legislation that could impact the risk of improper payments. In FY 24, 34 programs completed a risk assessment. Of these 34 risk assessments, 31 were found not susceptible to significant improper payments and three were found susceptible to significant improper payments. The three programs that were found susceptible to significant improper payments were the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA), Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) US Coronavirus Payments, and IRS US Coronavirus Refundable Credits. These three COVID-19 pandemic relief programs, along with two other COVID-19 pandemic relief program, IRS Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit and Air Carrier Payroll Support Programs (PSP), also known as Pandemic Relief for Aviation Workers, were determined to be susceptible to improper payments in previous years. However, in August 2022 Treasury determined that due to the short-term nature of these programs, quantifying the amount and rate of improper payments, assessing the root cause, and developing corrective action plans to reduce payment errors in the future would provide minimal value and be an ineffective use of resources. Therefore, for its COVID-19 pandemic relief programs, Treasury decided it would not report an improper payment estimate either in its Agency Financial Report or on paymentaccuracy.gov. These programs remain in the risk assessment rotation.

Treasury reports error rates as outlined in the PIIA and OMB Appendix C, for four refundable tax credits (RTCs)—the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC), Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), and net Premium Tax Credit (PTC). 

The root cause of the errors in the EITC, AOTC, ACTC, and net PTC RTCs is not the result of internal control deficiencies and, as such, the IRS has continuously deployed costly tools to in effort to lower the error rate. These tools include training, such as the nationwide tax forum, due diligence training module and webinars, cross enterprise sharing with other Federal agencies, and change processes such as hosting annual Dependent Database meetings with stakeholders to adjust the value of prior-year compliance filters for audit selection of returns claiming the RTCs and identifying improvement opportunities for the filing season. Deployment of enforcement tools has had minimal impact on lowering the error rate. The IRS continues significant efforts to bring its improper payment rate for these RTC programs to less than 10 percent.

Treasury was found non-compliant with 2 of the 10 PIIA reporting requirements for FY23. Specifically, Treasury did not adequately conclude whether programs are likely to make Improper Payments (IPs) and Unknown Payments (UPs) above or below the statutory threshold for the ERA and PSP pandemic relief programs; and did not comply with the requirement to report an improper payment rate of less than 10 percent for four the IRS RTC programs mentioned above (EITC, AOTC, ACTC, and Net PTC). Treasury complied with the remaining eight PIIA requirements. Treasury corrective action plans to bring ERA and PSP into compliance by May 2025. While the improper payment rates did decrease in EITC, AOTC, and ACTC, it remains a significant challenge to bring the RTC programs into compliance with the PIIA without significant legislative action and restructuring.","2024"

(Unit- Free-Text)","VA has established recovery audits in a manner that maximizes efficiency; therefore, many programs payments are audited for overpayments that can be recovered using the same processes and procedures. These are discussed in more detail below.

Veterans Health Administration

The Veterans Health Administration utilizes a recovery audit contract, which will audit claims for the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Community Care, and Spina Bifida programs.  All three programs were tested to ensure the reimbursement was based on the appropriate methodology and that the medical records support the diagnostic related group billed for the services.  The VA Community Care review also includes pre-authorized claims paid under 38 United States Code § 1703 (authorized care) and will test to ensure the care rendered is in compliance with the authorization/referral.

Veterans Benefits Administration

The Veterans Benefits Administration uses a combination of quality reviews and payment reviews to identify possible duplicates and overpayments. The majority of Veterans Benefits Administration programs perform quality reviews on randomly selected cases that ensure eligibility determinations, proper case processing, and payment accuracy. For all other programs, Veterans Benefits Administration performs payment reviews to identify potential duplicate payments and other potential overpayments. Veterans Benefits Administration tracks, monitors, and recovers overpayments eligible for recovery through combined efforts of the Debt Management Center, the Administrative and Loan Accounting Center, and Regional Offices. 

Office of Revolving Funds

The Office of Revolving Funds collaborates with the Office of Inspector General to perform recovery audits on VA's Supply Fund program. The Office of Inspector General identifies an overpayment and a bill of collection is then prepared by the Office of Revolving Funds with appropriate terms of collection. If the vendor chooses to dispute the bill of collection Veterans Affairs will work towards appropriate resolution.","2024"

USAID annually assesses the risk of improper payments in all program areas in fiscal year (FY) 2023 and FY 2024 to ensure proper assessment activities are conducted as following the methodology outlined in the OMB guidance. USAID's programs and activities are in Phase 1, and no programs and activities are in Phase 2. USAID conducts risk assessments for all programs and activities with outlays over $10 million on three-year risk assessment cycle and the result of those assessments indicated that USAID does not have programs which are likely to be susceptible to significant improper payments. The next scheduled risk assessment is planned for FY 2025. USAID has no high-priority program in monetary loss in excess of $100 million. USAID has a 97.94 percent recapture rate for recovering activities for overpayment identified in FY 2024. (*Please note that there is Variance of .01% = (97.95% - 97.94%) which is due to rounding in the tables below.) 

USAID continues to monitor and assess the improper payment reviews to ensure appropriate integrity and accuracy of payments such as testing transactions, data analysis techniques and self-reports from missions overseas and Washington every 6 months. 

USAID implements improved controls, enhanced training and better data management practices to prevent future overpayments from occurring. 

To complement its extensive pre-payment controls, USAID has implemented a series of post-payment activities to satisfy audit requirements for recapturing payments. USAID has determined that it is not cost effective to engage a contracted audit firm for recapture-testing; rather, the Agency’s internal control activities supplement testing for improper payment by focusing enhanced scrutiny on grants and contracts, which make up a significant portion of USAID’s expenditures.

To achieve these targets, FNS will continue to conduct training for State agencies on an ongoing basis and will provide additional tools to conduct root cause analysis and identify trends in error rate data. In FY 2025, FNS will facilitate two meetings focused on assisting States in determining their root causes of error and corrective actions to address them. In FY 2026, FNS will launch a new, modernized payment accuracy data management system, which will include enhanced data analytics features to assist State agencies in better utilizing their data for root cause analysis and corrective action planning.

This is evidenced by VA reporting its sixth consecutive year of reductions in improper and unknown payments – a reduction of about $1 billion or 32%. These efforts have also allowed VA to remove a total of seven programs from reporting improper and unknown payments during this same timeframe. In FY 2025, VA will also remove the Communications, Utilities and Other Rents program from reporting improper and unknown payment reporting requirements due to its reporting under the statutory thresholds. Below are some highlighted activities occurring across the Department to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent as intended and VA fulfills this nations promise to its Veterans.

Veterans Health Administration
Veterans Health Administration has developed effective internal controls to identify potential improper payments on a continual (real-time) basis in multiple systems at multiple levels throughout the life cycle of a claim from when the medical provider/third party administrator submits the claim, to the claim processing through the VA source system, and when the claim is issued for payment and adjudication. Significant reduction in and prevention of improper and unknown payments over the last six years are attributed to the development of proactive business rules built into the claims processing systems that allows claims that meet all rules to auto-adjudicate without human intervention. Artificial intelligence and pre-payment control logic is also built in and includes, but is not limited to, duplicate checks, aberrant billing patterns, coding and billing errors, and checks against the List of Excluded Individuals and Entities. Additional checks include service, equipment, or drugs not covered; charge exceeds the maximum allowable rate; or the provider was not certified/eligible to be paid for the procedure/service on the date of service.

Veterans Benefits Administration
As part of Veterans Benefits Administration Do Not Pay - Activities, multiple internal and external activities outside of the Treasury Working System are in place that focus on the prevention of overpayments. Veterans Benefits Administration receives continuous information from several Federal agencies, which it uses to verify the status of Veterans Affairs beneficiaries. This information identifies instances where there may be inconsistencies between VA records and data furnished by other Federal agencies that may affect entitlement to Compensation and Pension benefits. The following describes the various agreements:

Fugitive Felon Match - The Office of Inspector General entered into a computer matching agreement with law enforcement agencies for a list of individuals with felony arrest warrants to match against VA records, identifying beneficiaries that might be fugitive felons.

Social Security Verification Match - Quarterly, the Social Security Administration provides information on Social Security Administration rates for recipients of VA Pension and Parents' Dependency and Indemnity Compensation to verify reported income.

Social Security Administration Prison Match - The Social Security Administration provides VA with information on prisoners. Periodically, data from Compensation and Pension records are run against Social Security's inmate database to identify VA beneficiaries who may be subject to reduction or termination of benefits.

The Bureau of Prisons Match - Provides Veterans Benefits Administration with information on Federal prisoners. On a monthly basis, Compensation and Pension files are matched with Bureau of Prisons' inmate database to identify incarcerated beneficiaries, which may require a reduction of termination of benefits.

The Social Security Death Master File - The Social Security Administration provides VA a list of deceased individuals. On a weekly basis, Compensation and Pension records are matched with the Death Master File to identify possible deceased beneficiaries to determine if benefits need to be terminated.  

The Federal Tax Information Match – Weekly, the Internal Revenue Service provides income and net worth information. Claimant records who are initially applying for VA Pension and Parents' Dependency and Indemnity Compensation are matched to verify reported income and assets.  

Financial Services Center
The Financial Services Center (FSC) leverages data available within the Treasury Working System via Computer Matching Agreements with Treasury to continually update the vendor file used to store payee information for individuals and vendors doing business with VA. Potential matches are identified in the file and will be used if invoices/claims are submitted from matched individuals and vendors in the future. The FSC is continuing the partnership with Treasury to utilize additional data that will improve customer service, to include reducing the time it takes to validate new vendors or changes to existing vendor information. This partnership and use of data made available to Treasury by various federal agencies will improve VA’s ability to stop future potential improper payments in a pre-payment state.

Additionally, FSC reviews prepayments scheduled for future payment for all customer field stations against any other scheduled payments and payment history daily. FSC utilizes the Invoice Payment Processing System and Business Activity Monitoring system as part of the invoice review process, and the data sources contain business rules designed to assist with the identification and prevention of improper payments. Payments determined to be duplicates are denied before the payment is disbursed.","2024"

Performance bonuses and/or salary increases are aligned with each Senior Executive’s overall level of performance.","2024"
"VA","CAP5","[CAP5]Provide 6-10 sentences summarizing the conclusions and recommendation(s) provided by the OIG for each non-compliant criterion AND the actions and measurable milestones the program has planned to bring each program into compliance with each non-compliant criterion. (Unit - Free-Text) ","In May 2024, the VA Office of Inspector General found 71 VA programs fully compliant with PIIA. The Office of Inspector General found two programs noncompliant with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019, Pension and Purchased Long Term Services and Supports.

The Pension program was found noncompliant with compliance criteria 6, achieving an improper payment and unknown payment rate of less than 10%. VA's Inspector General recommended that the Pension program reduce improper and unknown payments to below 10%. The Pension program continues to prioritize and implement corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper payments. Although the Pension program remains noncompliant and reported an increase in overall improper and unknown payments, the program underwent improvements in FY 2024 that will improve its ability to reduce improper and unknown payments in the future. This included updating testing procedures to correctly differentiate monetary loss from unknown payments, increasing detail obtained during testing to improve development of effective corrective actions, and improving corrective actions planned for FY 2025. Actions planned regarding automation include continuing quarterly matches with the Social Security Administration to identify variances between Social Security Administration income a beneficiary is receiving versus the amounts reported by a beneficiary to VA. Differences indicate potential changes in a beneficiary’s income, which could require a change to their pension benefit. Validating whether a change is needed and making changes, if necessary, prevents future improper payments. Ensuring accurate documentation of Social Security Administration income prevents future improper payments. Actions planned regarding audit include randomly reviewing claims processors’ work to ensure policies and procedures are properly applied in making accurate pension rate decisions to prevent future improper payments. Actions planned regarding training include training staff to ensure policies and procedures are properly applied in making accurate pension rate decision to prevent future improper payments. Given the time it takes to implement corrective actions and mitigation strategies, the program expects the continued positive impact of these actions on FY 2025 payments and anticipates the Office of Inspector General will determine the program compliant with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 in May 2027. The Pension program tracks the measurable milestones included in its corrective action plan no less than quarterly throughout the fiscal year, to ensure actions planned are appropriately prioritized and designed to mitigate risks of improper and unknown payments.

In addition, the Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program was found noncompliant with compliance criteria 6, achieving an improper payment and unknown payment rate of less than 10%. The Office of Inspector General recommended that the Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program reduce improper and unknown payments to below 10%. The Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program continues to prioritize and implement effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper and unknown payments. Although the Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program remains noncompliant, the impact of the program changes in recent years is reflected in a decrease in the improper and unknown payment rate from 38.72% in FY2023 to 13.52% (for a 25.2% reduction) and a $657.90 million decrease in improper payments in FY 2024, despite increases in program spending. Actions planned regarding automation include updating the claims processing system to pay Bowel and Bladder and Community Nursing Home claims appropriately. Actions planned regarding change process include moving to a standardized rate schedule for Community Nursing Home payments in order to transition from a legacy system to an automated claims adjudication system. Additionally, VA will continue clarifying payment methodology with third-party administrators to bill at the correct allowable rates, and will work to implement short- and long-term contracting options for Community Nursing Home payments to improve compliance with procurement requirements. Further, VA will resolve contracting requirements involving missing signatures and inability to reconcile procurement vendor to invoice vendor, and will establish Veterans Care Agreements when appropriate. Actions planned regarding training include working internally with facilities to provide education and training to resolve missing documentation related to authorization, payment or Veteran level of care to support the payment process. Given the time it takes to implement corrective actions and mitigation strategies, the program expects the continued positive impact of these actions on FY 2025 payments and anticipates the Office of Inspector General will determine the program compliant with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 in May 2028. The Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program tracks the measurable milestones included in its corrective action plan no less than quarterly throughout the fiscal year, to ensure actions planned are appropriately prioritized and designed to mitigate risks of improper and unknown payments.","2024"

"VA","exs1","[exs1] Provide an executive summary of the payment integrity activities and results for the agency for this reporting period (SEE - 'Helpful Hint' - minimum length requirements vary depending on Agency status). (Unit - Free-Text)","VA has made great progress in the reduction of improper and unknown payments as it continues to implement Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) requirements. Since FY 2018, VA has reduced improper and unknown payments by $12.6 billion, or 85% and removed a total of 7 programs from reporting requirements, utilizing mitigation strategies and corrective actions that prioritized the largest proportion of errors and noncompliance with laws and regulations. In FY 2024, VA is also pleased to announce that the Communications, Utilities, and Other Rents program is reporting under the statutory thresholds and will be removed from reporting requirements in FY 2025.

PIIA requires agencies to review and assess all programs and activities with annual outlays greater than $10 million for improper payment risk at least once every 3 years to identify those susceptible to significant improper payments. In addition, VA conducts off-cycle improper payment risk assessments when a significant change in legislation and/or a significant change in funding occurs as required by Office of Management and Budget. For FY 2024, VA is reporting 65 programs subject to risk assessment requirements with 24 programs completing an improper and unknown payment risk assessment. Of these, 23 programs, or 96%, were determined unlikely to be at significant risk of improper and unknown payments, defined as $10 million and 1.5% of outlays or $100 million in total. The Compensation program improper payment risk assessment results determined the program is likely to be at significant risk of improper and unknown payments. As a result, the Compensation program will report a statistically valid projection in FY 2025. In addition, in accordance with Office of Management and Budget guidance, 3 new programs identified during FY 2024 will initiate the 3-year risk assessment cycle early in FY 2025.

For those programs determined to be at risk of significant improper and unknown payments in the previous year, PIIA requires agencies to follow OMB implementation guidance for testing, reporting, and remediating improper and unknown payments. For FY 2024, VA is reporting a total of $2.2 billion in projected improper and unknown payments across 7 programs: Beneficiary Travel; Communications, Utilities, and Other Rents; Medical Care Contracts and Agreements; Pension; Purchased Long Term Services and Supports; Supplies and Materials; and VA Community Care. Specifically, VA reports $1.1 billion in monetary loss, $731.5 million in non-monetary loss improper payments ($32.6 million in underpayments, $698.9 million in technically improper), and $328.0 million in unknown payments. From FY 2023 to FY 2024, VA is reporting a reduction in monetary loss of $681.6 million or 38%. VA’s reported improper and unknown payments is a reduction of about $1 billion or 32% from FY 2023 results and is VA’s sixth consecutive year of reported reductions. It is important to note that VA efforts to reduce improper and unknown payments outpaced overall outlay increases of $4.4 billion in FY 2024, or 12%, due to effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies.                                                              

For FY 2024, 4 VA programs (Communications, Utilities, and Other Rents, Medical Care Contracts and Agreements, Purchased Long Term Services and Supports, and VA Community Care) achieved a reduction in their improper and unknown payment rates and amounts. The remaining 3 programs (Beneficiary Travel, Pension, and Supplies and Materials) reported an increase; however, these programs did make improvements in FY 2024 that will reduce future improper and unknown payments. Reductions to overall improper and unknown payments is attributed to VA’s robust process to update corrective action plans annually based on testing results, and no less than quarterly throughout the fiscal year, to ensure actions are appropriately prioritized and designed to mitigate risks of improper and unknown payments. Effectiveness reviews are also conducted annually to measure if actions reduced or were properly designed to reduce improper and unknown payments using set benchmarks for specific root causes.

In FY 2024, VA’s highest contributors of monetary losses were within VA’s control and occurred when programs failed to access the data/information needed to validate correct beneficiary award amounts or that claims were paid in accordance with contract rates. These errors accounted for $594.8 million, or 27% of VA’s total improper and unknown payments. To remediate these errors, VA will continue to implement actions that include identifying variances between reported Social Security Administration income a beneficiary is receiving versus the amounts reported by a beneficiary to VA. In addition, VA will clarify payment methodology, ensure that invoices are paid per the contract pricing, and implement system updates to ensure claims are paid appropriately. 

In FY 2024, VA's highest contributor of technically improper payments did not meet statutory or regulatory requirements because purchases were made without a contract utilizing a Basic Ordering Agreement or VA was missing written documentation to support ordering officer delegations. These errors accounted for $511.9 million, or 24% of VA's total improper and unknown payments. To remediate these errors, VA will continue to implement short- and long-term contracting options to improve compliance with procurement requirements and will improve contract processes to ensure payment accuracy.

In FY 2024, VA’s Inspector General concluded that the agency was noncompliant with PIIA. VA was noncompliant because the improper and unknown payment rate in two programs, Pension and Purchased Long Term Services and Supports, was greater than 10%. The Pension program will conduct quarterly matches with the Social Security Administration to identify variances in income amounts between Social Security income a beneficiary is receiving versus the amounts reported by a beneficiary to VA. In addition, the program will randomly review claims processors’ work and train staff to ensure policies and procedures are properly applied in making accurate pension rate decisions to prevent future improper payments. The Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program plans to move to a standardized rate schedule to transition Community Nursing Home payments to an automated claims processing system; update the claims processing system to pay claims appropriately; continue clarifying payment methodology with third-party administrators to bill at the correct rates; continue implementing short- and long-term contracting options for Community Nursing Home payments to improve compliance with procurement requirements; and provide education and training to resolve missing documentation errors. The agency anticipates the Office of Inspector General will determine the Pension program compliant in May 2027 and the PLTSS program compliant in May 2028.","2024"

(Unit- Free-Text)","VA fulfills the requirements of the Do Not Pay (DNP) Initiative and reviews payments against Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) required databases. VA utilizes the Treasury Working Systems (TWS) as appropriate. VA utilizes the TWS payment integration functionality. Payment integration consists of matching payments against available TWS data sources at the time of disbursement. Specifically, VA submits the Payment Automation Manager (PAM) file to the Department of Treasury for matching against the TWS data sources. The Department of Treasury uses DNP to perform matching of PAM Payments to TWS data sources and provides a PAM count of stopped payments and/or count of matched payments. The TWS match results are available in the TWS the next business day for adjudication. VA downloads TWS match results and review and adjudication of TWS matches are performed in accordance with VA processes and procedures. There are two reports available for download in the TWS. The Payment Activity Report (PAR) provides VA a summary of the PAM payments, matches, and adjudication statuses. The Adjudication Summary report provides VA the summary adjudication status results each month. VA adjudicates matches within the TWS on a monthly basis. Therefore, VA is only able to use the TWS to confirm improper payments after the payment has been already made and prevent future improper payments once due process is provided for payment integration. In addition, VA utilizes single search and continuous monitoring when appropriate, unless other already established processes outside the TWS exists. Reports are not currently available from TWS on the results of single search and continuous monitoring.","2024"
