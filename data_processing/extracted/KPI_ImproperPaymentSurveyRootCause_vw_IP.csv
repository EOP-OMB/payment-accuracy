In addition, the Public Assistance program began the update process for the Public Assistance Program and Policy Guide (PAPPG), with publication planned for FY 2025 Quarter 2. In FY 2025 Quarter 2, FEMA will have published the updates to the PAPPG and be well into the annual payment integrity process to review disbursement activity, evaluate risks, and conduct statistical testing for programs determined to be susceptible to significant improper payments, including statistical testing over the FY 2023 disbursement activity of the Public Assistance VAYGo program.

As ongoing efforts, FEMA remains focused on training, both internally for FEMA personnel as well as externally to SLTTs and recipients.

As such, payments are made to qualified travelers who didn’t provide proper documents to support travel payments. Approving Officials fail to identify invalid receipts and adherence to DoD Regulations prior to approving expenses exacerbates the issues with the DoD’s reliance on recordkeeping systems that are decentralized, heavily interfaced, manually intensive, and susceptible to human error. The DoD pursued a collective approach with the Military Branches and the Defense Travel Management Office to reduce IPs. Corrective actions spearhead the effort to reduce IPs by outlining training/communication initiatives to improve compliance with statutory requirements and ensure documentation is understood, submitted, and reviewed appropriately. The DoD conducted extensive training to reduce/prevent IPs. The Army Financial Management & DFAS Customer Workshop conducted trainings on recent updates to processes and provide guidance on frequent causes of IPs. The Department of Air Force (DAF) conducted trainings each month on common causes of IPs in the Defense Travel System (DTS) and the proper use of the DTS Compliance Tool. The tool ensures timely and accurate IP reporting, tracks recoveries to collection, and is a means for the DAF to analyze and address root causes of IPs.

Only four errors were found in testing, which included one payment in the amount of $1679.25. This one identified error forecasted the impact of our projected improper payment for this category to $302M.

R&A is collaborating with Disbursing on a Lean 6 project focused on refining and enhancing the Reclamation Process. This is in preparation of an Internal Review audit slated for June 2023 which will further test Disbursing’s reclamation process.
R&A pursued efforts with Treasury and VA to implement use of the Treasury Do Not Pay (DNP) file. During R&A’s testing it was determined that pertinent death data was missing. As a result R&A is still pursuing use of the DNP and has continued collaboration with Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC). DMDC is actively working with an outside source to receive new and improved death data on a more frequent base which is on track for implementation in CY 2024.

The funding provided relief to transit agencies for ongoing operations rather than traditional capital investments. The primary root cause of the programâ€™s improper payments is the timing when transit operating expenses became eligible for reimbursement. The new eligibilities from COVID relief funds did not align with the prior period accounting adjustments made during the testing period such as: reimbursements, accruals, and payroll reversals. FTA COVID relief funds are not administered at the Federal level and overpayments are outside of FTA control when grant recipients make administrative errors.","Please choose Root Cause 1.","Overpayments outside the agency control that occurred because of a Failure to Access Data/Information Needed.","FTA Transit Infrastructure Grants - COVID Relief activities rely on the internal controls and financial systems of transit authorities to effectively administer program funds.

To prevent future overpayments, payment disbursement training and standardized practices for calculating payments and deductions were developed. This includes leveraging pay files, systems, validating recipients for application-based payments, and exploratory analysis for determining and authenticating recipients’ payment history. Pre-payment controls were also implemented, such as manually validating high-dollar payments and additional peer reviewers to aid in identifying and correcting errors before payment disbursement.

As of March 31, 2025, the agency’s implementation of the repeal has resulted in paying 2.3 million people more than $14.7 billion in retroactive payments.  We began releasing higher monthly benefit payments in April 2025.

On December 31, 2024, we published the final rule for implementing the Payroll Information Exchange (PIE) with commercial payroll data providers to obtain wage and employment information.  PIE will reduce our reliance on self-reporting of this information.  On April 7, 2025, we completed an initial exchange of 1 million Social Security numbers (SSN). We will gradually increase the exchanges, reaching 10 million SSNs by August 2025.  We anticipate reaching full implementation by September 2025 with approximately 12 million SSNs.

operating in public and nonprofit private schools and residential child care institutions. It
reimburses participating schools and institutions for the cost of providing meals to eligible children. SBP overpayments are primarily due to errors in determining children's eligibility for program benefits. Errors in counting and claiming meals for federal reimbursement is a secondary source of over payment. The most significant barrier to prevention is the decentralized nature of the program. Certifying children for benefits and counting meals for reimbursement are handled independently by tens of thousands of schools and school districts.","Please choose Root Cause 1.","Overpayments outside the agency control that occurred because of a Failure to Access Data/Information Needed.","USDAâ€™s Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) and Direct Certification with Medicaid pilot
projects (DC-M) use cross-agency data sharing to certify children for SBP benefits
without application error. Not all eligible states, schools and districts participate in CEP or DC-M.","305.96","Automation - automatically controlled operation, process, or system","USDA provides resources to help states improve integrity. FNS facilitates conversations
with states to maximize direct certification, which reduces error by eliminating household
applications. Household applications are our biggest source of error.","FNS worked to improve and update its verification process in its Summer EBT application. This introduces a new module to improve the rigor of the process. Specifically, it includes a feedback loop where FNS will review the outcomes of verification in the first year to approve targeting of high-risk applications in future years. The Summer EBT application is nearly identical to the NSLP/SBP application, so improvements here will demonstrate how to states how the same process can be applied in NLSP/SBP.","Q1 2025"

VA reviewed the variances, identified the largest potential overpayments, and sent potential overpayment claims weekly for claims processor review and corrective action, creating overpayments when applicable. VA also conducted an audit of Federal Tax Information (FTI) on initial pension applications (approximately 15,280 claims). This audit identified variances between income reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) versus amounts reported to VA on applications. Claims identified with variances were sent to claims processors to resolve and prevent overpayments. During Q2, VA conducted a Targeted Program Review (TPR) of FTI exclusion in claimants over 90 years old. Preliminary findings indicate no discrepancies in income reporting, and the TPR is expected to be finalized in Q3. VA also conducted National Quality Review (NQR) audits (41 claims monthly) using a standardized checklist, which identified potential overpayments. In Q3, VA will continue conducting the quarterly SSA data match and reviewing FTI on initial applications to detect variances. NQR audits will review 41 claims monthly, and VA will perform a site visit along with special audits to ensure policies and procedures are properly applied in making accurate pension decisions to prevent future improper payments.","Q2 2025"
